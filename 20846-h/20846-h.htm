<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>This book is intended primarily for teachers of woodwork, but the
author hopes that there will also be other workers in wood, professional
and amateur, who will find in it matter of interest and profit.</p>

<p>The successful completion of the book is due chiefly to the untiring
assistance of my wife, Anna Gausmann Noyes, who has made
almost all of the drawings, corrected the text, read the proof, and
attended to numberless details.</p>

28, 29, 31, 33, and 54.</p>

<h3>LOGGING.</h3>


<p>The rough and ready methods common in American logging operations
are the result partly of a tradition of inexhaustible supply,
partly of the fear of fire and the avoidance of taxes, partly of an
eagerness to get rich quick. Most of the logging has been done on
privately owned land or on shamelessly stolen public land, and the
lumberman had no further interest in the forest than to lumber it
expeditiously.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/001-600.png" width="600" height="376" alt="Fig. 1. Making a Valuation Survey." /><br /><br />Fig. 1. Making a Valuation Survey.</div>

<p>Preliminary to the actual logging are certain necessary steps.
First of all is <i>landlooking</i>. This includes the survey of the forest
land for the purpose of locating good timber. Fig. 1. Most of the
woodland has previously been roughly surveyed by the government
and maps made indicating which parts are private land and which
are still held by the government. The boundaries of townships, sections,
quarter sections, eighties, forties, etc., are indicated by "blazes"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[page&nbsp;8]</span>
on trees, Fig. 2, so that the "cruiser" or "looker" as he goes thru the
woods can identify them with those on his oil paper map. The cruiser
also studies the kinds and character
of the trees, the contour of
the ground, the proximity to
streams,&mdash;all with the view to
marketing the product. Acting
on the information thus gained
by the cruiser, the lumberman
purchases his sections at the
proper land office, or if he is
less scrupulous, buys only
enough to serve as a basis for
operations. Enormous fortunes
have been made by timber
thieves, now respectable members
of the community. As a further
preliminary step to lumbering
itself, the <i>tote road</i> and
<i>camp</i> are built. The tote road
is a rough road on which supplies
for crew and cattle can be
taken to camp from civilization.</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is barely passable for a team and a wagon, but it serves its purpose, and
over it come more men and horses. Lumber for the floors and roofs of the shanties
and for the rude pieces of furniture that will be needed, tarred paper to
make the roofs tight, a few glazed window sashes, a huge range and a
number of box stoves, dishes and kitchen utensils, a little stock of goods
for the van, blankets by the dozen and score, and countless boxes and barrels
and bags of provisions.<sup style="font-size: 0.7em;">1</sup></p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 1: Hulbert: The Lumber Jack; Outlook, 76: 801, April 2, '04.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <i>camp</i> itself, Fig. 3, is built of logs, roofed with plank, covered
with heavy tar paper, and dimly lighted. There are usually
five buildings,&mdash;the men's camp, the cook camp, the office, the barn,
and the blacksmith's shop. Many camps accommodate from eighty
to one hundred men. The men's camp is filled with bunks and is
heated by a stove and in general roughly furnished. Cooking and
eating are done in the cook camp, where the cook and his assistant,
the "cookee," sleep. The office is occupied by the foreman, log-sealers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[page&nbsp;9]</span>
and clerks. Here the books and accounts are kept, and here is
the "van," stocked with such goods as will supply the immediate
needs of the lumber jacks.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/003-600.png" width="600" height="304" alt="Fig. 3. Winter Logging Camp. Itasco County, Minnesota." /><br /><br />Fig. 3. Winter Logging Camp. Itasco County, Minnesota.</div>

<p>Before winter sets in the <i>main road</i> is built, Fig. 15, <a class="index" href="#page17">p. 17</a>, very
carefully graded from the camp down to the nearest mill or railway
siding, or oftener to the stream down which the logs are to be floated.
This road has to be as wide as a city street, 25 feet. The route is
carefully chosen, and the grade is made as easy as possible. Much
labor is spent upon it, clearing away stumps and rocks, leveling up
with corduroy, building bridges strong enough to carry enormous
loads, and otherwise making it as passable as can be; for when
needed later, its good condition is of first importance. This main
road is quite distinct from and much superior to the tote road.</p>

<p>At intervals alongside the main road, small squares called <i>skidways</i>
are cleared of brush and in each of them two tree trunks,
"skids," are laid at right angles to the road. On these the logs, when
cut later, are to be piled. Back from the skidways, into the woods
the swampers cut rough, narrow roads called <i>dray roads</i> or travoy
roads,&mdash;mere trails sufficiently cleared of brush to allow a team of
horses to pull a log thru.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[page&nbsp;10]</span>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/004-424a.png" width="424" height="500" alt="Fig. 4. Tools used in Logging." /><br /><br />Fig. 4. Tools used in Logging.</div>

<p>All these are operations preliminary to the felling of trees. The
tools commonly used in logging are shown in Fig. 4. When everything
is ready for felling, the "fitter" goes ahead <i>marking</i> each tree
to be felled and the direction in which it is to fall by cutting a
notch on that side. Then come the sawyers in pairs, Fig. 5. First
they chop a deep gash on the side of the tree toward which it is to
fall, and then from the opposite side begin cutting with a long,
Tuttle-tooth, crosscut-saw. The saw is a long, flexible ribbon of
steel, with handles so affixed to each end that they can be removed
easily. The cut is made on the pulling stroke, and hence the kerf
can be very narrow. As soon as the saw is well within the trunk,
the sawyers drive iron wedges into the kerf behind it, partly to keep
the weight of the trunk from binding the saw, and partly to direct
its fall. Then the saw is pulled back and forth, and the wedges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[page&nbsp;11]</span>
driven in farther and farther, until every stroke of the maul that
drives them sends a shiver thru the whole tree. Just as the tree
is ready to go over, the saw handle
at one end is unhooked and
the saw pulled out at the other
side. "Timber!," the men cry
out as a warning to any working
near by, for the tree has begun
to lean slightly. Then with a
hastening rush the top whistles
thru the air, and tears thru the
branches of other trees, and the
trunk with a tremendous crash
strikes the ground. Even hardened
loggers can hardly keep
from shouting, so impressive is
the sight of a falling giant tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/005-337.png" width="337" height="450" alt="Fig. 5. Felling Red Spruce with a Saw." /><br /><br />Fig. 5. Felling Red Spruce with a Saw. <br />Adirondack Mountains, New York.</div>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/006-600.png" width="600" height="360" alt="Fig. 6. Sawing Logs into Lengths." /><br /><br />Fig. 6. Sawing Logs into Lengths.</div>

<p>All this seems simple enough
in outline, but the actual execution
requires considerable skill.
Trees seldom stand quite vertical,
there is danger of lodging in some other tree in thick woods, and it
is therefore necessary to throw trees quite exactly. Some men become
so expert at this that they can plant a stake and drive it into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[page&nbsp;12]</span>
ground by the falling trunk as truly as if they hit it with a maul.
On the other hand, serious accidents often happen in falling trees.
Most of them come
from "side winders,"
i.&nbsp;e., the falling of
smaller trees struck by
the felled trees.</p>

<p>After "falling" a
tree, the sawyers mark
off and saw the trunk
into log lengths, Fig.
6, paying due attention
to the necessity of
avoiding knots, forks,
and rotten places, so
that some of the logs
are eighteen feet, some
sixteen feet, some fourteen
feet, and some only
twelve feet in length. Meanwhile the swampers trim off the branches,
Fig. 7, a job requiring no little skill, in order that the trunk may be
shaved close but not gashed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/007-494.png" width="494" height="450" alt="Fig. 7. Trimming off Branches of Spruce." /><br /><br />Fig. 7. Trimming off Branches of Spruce.<br /> Adirondack Mountains, New York.</div>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/008-600.png" width="600" height="377" alt="Fig. 8. Hauling Spruce Logs to the Skidway." /><br /><br />Fig. 8. Hauling Spruce Logs to the Skidway.<br />Adirondack Mountains, New York.</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[page&nbsp;13]</span>

<p>This finishes the second group of operations, the felling. Next
the logs are <i>dragged</i> out to the dray roads, Fig. 8. A heavy pair of
tongs, like ice-tongs, is attached to one end, and the log is snaked
out by horses to the skidway. If the log is very heavy, one end is
put on a dray. By one way or another the log is dragged out and
across the two parallel skids, on which it is rolled by cant-hooks to
the end of skids toward the road way. If other logs already occupy
the skids, each new log as it arrives is piled on the first tier. As the
pile grows higher, each log is "decked," that is, rolled up parallel
poles laid slanting up the face of the pile, by means of a chain passed
under and over the log and back over the pile, Fig. 11. A horse
hitched to the end of the chain hauls up the log, which is guided by
the "send-up men" with their cant-hooks.</p>

<p>Once piled the logs are "<i>scaled</i>," that is measured in order to
compute the number of board feet in them, Fig. 9. The scaler generally
has an
assistant, for
logs in large
piles must be
measured at
both ends in
order to determine
which is
the top, the
body of the log
being out of
sight. When
measured each
end of the log
is stamped with
a hammer with the owner's mark, by which it can afterward be
identified. Here the logs rest and the felling and skidding continue
until deep snow falls and then the sleigh haul begins.</p>

<p>For this the main road is especially prepared. First the road is
carefully <i>plowed</i> with an immense V plow, weighted down by logs.
To the plow are attached fans. Only an inch or two of snow is left
on the ground by this plow, which is followed by another special
plow to gouge the ruts, and by a gang of "road monkeys" who clear
the road thoroly. Then follows an immense tank set on runners and
holding perhaps seventy-five barrels of water, and so arranged as to
flood the road from holes in the bottom of the tank, a sort of rough
road sprinkler, Fig. 10. The sprinkler goes over the road again
and again until the road is covered by a clear, solid sheet of ice often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[page&nbsp;15]</span>
two feet thick, extending from the skidways to the banking grounds.
This ice road is one of the modern improvements in logging. Once
finished, these roads are beautiful pieces of construction with deep,
clear ruts. They have to be constantly watched and repaired,
and this is the work of the "road monkeys." If possible the road
has been made entirely with down grades but some of these are
so steep that a man must be prepared with sand or hay to check too
headlong a descent.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/012-600.png" width="600" height="331" alt="Fig. 12. Loading a Sled from a Skidway." /><br /><br />Fig. 12. Loading a Sled from a Skidway.</div>

<p>When all is ready the sleigh haul begins. Piling on the sleighs
or bobs, Fig. 12, is similar to piling on the skidways, but more difficult,
for the load has to be
carefully balanced, Fig. 13.
Chains bind the loads but the
piling is only too apt to be
defective, and the whole load
"squash out" with a rush. It
is a time of feverish activity.
The sprinklers are at work till
after midnight, the loaders are
out long before daylight. The
blacksmith is busy with repairs,
the road monkeys work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[page&nbsp;16]</span>
overtime, and the cook works all the time. "Everybody works." The
haul itself is full of excitement. The ponderous load of logs, weighing
anywhere from eight to thirty-five tons has to be conducted largely
by its own momentum down this glassy road. If a horse fall nothing
can save its life. If the runners get out of the ruts, the whole
load, driver and all, is likely to be upset. It is an extremely hazardous
job, Fig. 15.</p>

<p>As each load comes down to the <i>banking grounds</i>, Fig. 14, or log
dump, it is stopped opposite long parallel skids. The wrapping chains
are unhooked
and the lower
log on the skid
side is worked
out with cant-hooks
till the
whole load flattens
out. The
logs are then
"decked" on
immense piles,
sometimes a
mile long and filling the whole river from bank to bank. A decking
chain 300 feet long is sometimes required to roll the logs to their
proper places. Here the logs rest till the spring freshets come. This
completes the transportation by land.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/014-600.png" width="600" height="325" alt="Fig. 14. Banking Grounds." /><br /><br />Fig. 14. Banking Grounds.</div>

<p>With the coming of the spring thaw, the river bed is filled with
a freshet of water which seizes and carries the logs down stream.
Many on the banks, however, have to be started on their way, and this
is called "breaking out the roll ways." They often start on their
water journey with a great crash.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[page&nbsp;17]</span>

<p>Now comes <i>the drive</i>, an arduous and often perilous task. Some
of the men are stationed along the shores to prevent the logs from
lodging or floating into bays or setbacks. Some stand at the heads
of bars or islands, where with pike poles they shove off the logs that
might stop there and form a jam; others follow "sacking the rear"
to clean out such logs as may have become stranded. This "sacking
the rear" takes most of the time, Fig. 16. While "on the drive"
men often work fourteen hours a day, a good part of the time up to
their waists in ice water. Their boots are shod with "caulks," or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[page&nbsp;18]</span>
spikes, to keep them from slipping on the logs, and they carry either
pike poles or peaveys, Fig. 17. The latter are similar to cant-hooks,
except that
they have
sharp pikes at
their ends. So
armed, they
have to "ride
any kind of a
log in any
water, to propel
a log by
jumping on it,
by rolling it
squirrel fashion
with the
feet, by punting
it as one
would a canoe;
to be skilful in pushing, prying, and poling other logs from the
quarter deck of the same cranky craft." Altho the logs are carried
by the river, they have to be "driven" with amazing skill and bravery.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/017-576.png" width="576" height="450" alt="Fig. 17. Log Driving on the Ausable River." /><br /><br />Fig. 17. Log Driving on the Ausable River.</div>

<p>The climax of hardship and courage is reached when a "<i>jam</i>" is
formed, Fig. 18. Sometimes one or two logs are caught in such
a way as to be locked or jammed and then soon other logs begin
to accumulate behind them, till the whole river is full of a seemingly
inextricable mass. Sometimes these jams can be loosened by being
pulled apart, one log at a time. A hundred men can pull out an
amazing number of logs in a day. The problem always is to set free
or cut out certain "key" logs, which lock the whole mass. Following
is a description by Stewart Edward White of the breaking of such
a jam:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The crew were working desperately. Down on the heap somewhere, two
logs were crossed in such a manner as to lock the whole. They sought
those logs.</p>

<p>Thirty feet above the bed of the river six men clamped their peaveys
into the soft pine; jerking, pulling, lifting, sliding the great logs from
their places. Thirty feet below, under the threatening face, six other men
coolly picked out and set adrift one by one, the timbers not inextricably
imbedded. From time to time the mass creaked, settled, perhaps even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[page&nbsp;19]</span>
moved a foot or two; but always the practised rivermen, after a glance,
bent more eagerly to their work. * * * Suddenly the six men below the
jam scattered. * * * holding their peaveys across their bodies, they
jumped lightly from one floating log to another in the zig-zag to shore. * * *
</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/018-600.png" width="600" height="412" alt="Fig. 18. Log Jam. Adirondack Mountains, New York." /><br /><br />Fig. 18. Log Jam. Adirondack Mountains, New York.</div>

<blockquote><p>
In the meantime a barely perceptible motion was communicating itself
from one particle to another thru the center of the jam. * * * The crew
redoubled its exertion, clamping its peaveys here and there, apparently at
random, but in reality with the most definite of purposes. A sharp crack
exploded immediately underneath. There could no longer exist any doubt
as to the motion, altho it was as yet sluggish, glacial. Then in silence a
log shifted&mdash;in silence and slowly&mdash;but with irresistible force * * * other
logs in all directions up-ended. * * *</p>

<p>Then all at once down by the face something crashed, the entire stream
became alive. It hissed and roared, it shrieked, groaned, and grumbled. At
first slowly, then more rapidly, the very fore-front of the center melted inward
and forward and downward, until it caught the fierce rush of the
freshet and shot out from under the jam. Far up-stream, bristling and
formidable, the tons of logs, grinding savagely together, swept forward. * * *</p>

<p>Then in a manner wonderful to behold, thru the smother of foam and
spray, thru the crash and yell of timbers, protesting the flood's hurrying,
thru the leap of destruction, the drivers zigzagged calmly and surely to the
shore.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes cables have to be stretched across the chasm, and special
rigging devised to let the men down to their dangerous task and
more especially to save them from danger when the crash comes.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[page&nbsp;20]</span>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/020-576.png" width="576" height="450" alt="Fig. 20. Splash-Dam." /><br /><br />Fig. 20. Splash-Dam.</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[page&nbsp;21]</span>

<p>In case such efforts are unavailing, it is necessary to "shoot" the
jam with dynamite. Another device resorted to where the supply of
water is insufficient is the <i>splash-dam</i>, Fig. 20. The object is to
make the operator independent of freshets, by accumulating a head
of water and then, by lifting the gates, creating an artificial freshet,
sufficient to float the timber down stream.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/022-535.png" width="535" height="450" alt="Fig. 22. A Sorting Jack." /><br /><br />Fig. 22. A Sorting Jack.</div>

<p>Thus by one means and another, the logs are driven along until
caught by a boom, Fig. 21, which consists of a chain of logs stretched
across the river, usually at a mill. Since the river is a common
carrier, the drives of a number of logging companies may float into
the mill pond together. But each log is stamped on both ends, so
that it can be sorted out, Fig. 22, and sent into the boom of its owner.</p>


<h4 style="margin-top: 3em;">MECHANICAL METHODS IN LUMBERING.</h4>

<p>The operations described above are those common in the lumber
regions of the northeast and the Lake States. But special conditions
produce special methods. A very effective device where streams are
small is the flume, Fig. 23. This is a long wooden trough thru
which water is led, and the logs floated end on. It is sometimes many
miles long; in one case in California twenty-five miles.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[page&nbsp;22]</span>

<p>In the South where there is no snow, logs are largely brought out
to the railway or river by being hung under immense two-wheeled
trucks, called slip-tongue carts, drawn by mules, Fig. 24. The
wheels are nearly eight feet in diameter.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/023-600.png" width="600" height="263" alt="Fig. 23. Six Mile Flume. Adirondack Mountains, New York." /><br /><br />Fig. 23. Six Mile Flume. Adirondack Mountains, New York.</div>

<p>Some kinds of wood are so heavy that they will not float at all,
and some sink so readily that it does not pay to transport them by
river. In such cases temporary railways are usually resorted to.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/024-600.png" width="600" height="206" alt="Fig. 24. Hauling Logs by Mules. Oscilla, Georgia." /><br /><br />Fig. 24. Hauling Logs by Mules. Oscilla, Georgia.</div>

<p>On the Pacific coast, where the forests are dense, the trees of enormous
size, and no ice road is possible, still other special methods have
been devised. On so great a scale are the operations conducted that
they may properly be called engineering feats. Consider for a moment
the size of the trees: red fir ranges from five to fifteen feet in
diameter, is commonly two hundred fifty feet high, and sometimes
three hundred twenty-five feet high. The logs are commonly cut
twenty-five feet long, and such logs often weigh thirty to forty tons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[page&nbsp;23]</span>
each, and the logs of a single tree may weigh together one hundred
fifty tons. The logging of such trees requires special appliances.
Until recently all the improved methods were in forms of transportation,
the felling still being done by hand with very long saws, Fig.
25, but now even the felling and sawing of logs in the forest is partly
done by machinery.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/025-600.png" width="600" height="418" alt="Fig. 25. A Twenty-Five Foot Saw used for Crosscutting Big Logs." /><br /><br />Fig. 25. A Twenty-Five Foot Saw used for Crosscutting Big Logs.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/026-600.png" width="600" height="327" alt="Fig. 26. Hauling Big Logs by Donkey Engine." /><br /><br />Fig. 26. Hauling Big Logs by Donkey Engine.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[page&nbsp;24]</span>

<p>To work the saw, power is supplied by a steam or gasoline engine
mounted upon a truck which can be taken readily from place to
place. As the maximum power required is not over ten-horse-power,
the apparatus is so light that it can be moved about easily. The saw
can be adjusted to cut horizontally, vertically, or obliquely, and hence
is used for sawing into lengths as well as for felling.</p>

<p><i>Falling beds.</i> Since the weight of a two hundred fifty foot fir is
such that if the impact of its fall be not gradually checked the force
with which it strikes the ground may split the trunk, a bed for its
fall is prepared by the swampers. Usually piles of brush are placed
as buffers along the "falling line" so that the trunk will strike these.
If the tree stands on the hill side, it is thrown up hill, in order to
shorten the fall.</p>

<p>After the felling comes the trimming of branches and knots and
"rossing" of bark, to lessen the friction in sliding along the skidway.</p>

<p><i>The skidway.</i> By the skidway in the Puget Sound region is
meant a corduroy road. This is constructed of trunks of trees ranging
from a foot to two feet in diameter. These are "rossed," that is,
stripped of their bark and laid across the road, where they are held
in place by pegs driven into the ground, and by strips spiked upon
the tops of the logs. If possible they are laid in swampy places to
keep the surface damp and slippery. At turns in the road, pulleys
are hung, thru which the hauling cables pass. The skidway runs to
the railway siding or water's edge. Over these skidways the logs are
hauled out by various means. Formerly "strings" of oxen or Percheron
horses were used, but they are now largely superseded by some
form of donkey engine, Fig. 26. These are placed at the center of
a "yard."</p>

<p>Yarding is the skidding of logs to the railway or water way by
means of these donkey engines. Attached to the donkey engine are
two drums, one for the direct cable, three-fourths to one inch in diameter
and often half a mile long, to haul in the logs, the other for
the smaller return cable, twice as long as the direct cable and used to
haul back the direct cable. At the upper end of the skidway, when
the logs are ready to be taken to the railway or boomed, they are
fastened together, end to end, in "turns" of four or more. The
direct cable is attached to the front of the "turn", and the return
cable to the rear end. By winding the direct cable on its drum, the
"turn" is hauled in. The return cable is used to haul back the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[page&nbsp;25]</span>
of the direct cable, and also, in case of a jam, to pull back and
straighten out the turn. Instead of a return cable a horse is often
used to haul out the direct cable. Signaling from the upper end of
the skidway to the engineer is done by a wire connected to the donkey's
whistle, by an electric bell, or by telephone.</p>

<p>Sometimes these donkey engines are in relays, one engine hauling
a turn of logs to within reach of the next one, which passes it on to
the next until the siding is reached.</p>

<p>Where there are steep canons to be crossed, a wire trolley may be
stretched and the great logs carried over suspended from it.</p>

<p>In the South a complicated machine called a steam skidder, Fig.
27, equipped with drums, booms, etc., is much used both for skidding
in the logs and then for loading them on the cars. It is itself
mounted on a flat car.</p>

<p>An improvement on this is the locomotive boom derrick which is
widely used both on the Pacific coast and of late in the Lake Superior
region. It is a combined locomotive, skidder and loader. Its
most unique feature is that it can be lifted off the track so as to allow
flat cars to run underneath it. This feat is accomplished thus: A
device, which is something like that used in elevating the bodies of
coal wagons, lifts the engine several feet above the rails. Then steel
legs, which are curved outwardly, are lowered until the shoes which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[page&nbsp;26]</span>
are attached to them rest on the outward end of the railroad ties.
The truck of the locomotive is then folded up under it out of the
way and cars can run under it, the curved legs giving plenty of
clearance. The derrick attached is of the breast type, the two legs
being firmly fastened. When anchored the engine can be used either
for skidding or loading. For skidding, there are two cables, one
being run out while the other is being wound on its drum.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/028-600.png" width="600" height="315" alt="Fig. 28. Log Train, Humboldt County, California." /><br /><br />Fig. 28. Log Train, Humboldt County, California.</div>

<p>In loading, the machine is located so that the empty car will be
directly in front of it, and then the logs are lifted up and placed on
the car by the derrick. When the car is loaded the machine can
either move on to the next car, or pull it under itself into place.
With the help of four men it can load from 125,000 to 150,000 feet
of timber in a day. By means of the cable it can make up a train,
and then by lowering the truck and raising the legs out of the way,
it is converted into a locomotive and hauls the train away to the mill
or railway station at the rate of three or four miles at hour.</p>

<p>As forests are cut away along the water courses, railways have to
be resorted to more and more, Fig. 28. This has had a stimulative
effect on the logging business, for now the logger is independent of the
snow. On account of the steep grades and sharp curves often necessary
in logging railways, a geared locomotive is sometimes used, Fig. 29.
It can haul a train of twenty loaded cars up a twelve per cent
grade. The geared engine has also been used as a substitute for
cable power, in "yarding" operations. The "turns" of logs are drawn
over the ground between the rails, being fastened to the rear of the
engine by hook and cable. This has proved to be a very economical
use of power and plant.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[page&nbsp;28]</span>
<p>Another method of traction where the woodland is open enough
is with a traction engine. The ones employed have sixty to one
hundred horse power. The great logs may be placed on wood rollers,
as a house is when moved, or the logs may be hauled in on a low
truck with broad wheels. The "tractor" hauls the log direct to the
railway if the distance is not too great.</p>

<p>In Northern Michigan a "snow locomotive," Fig. 31, is coming
into use, which has tremendous tractive power, hauling one hundred
to one hundred fifty tons of lumber over snow or ice. It moves on
runners, but there is between them a large cylinder armed with teeth.
This cylinder can be raised or lowered by the operator as it moves
over the surface of the ground. The teeth catch in the snow or ice,
and since the cylinder is heated by the exhaust steam, it melts and
packs the snow for the trucks following it. The drum is six feet in
diameter, with walls an inch and a half thick, and it weighs seven
tons. It is used in all sorts of places where horses cannot go, as in
swamps, and by substituting wheels for runners it has even been
used on sand.</p>

<p>In the Canadian lakes there has been devised a queer creature
called an "alligator," a small and heavily equipped vessel for hauling
the logs thru the lakes. When its operations in one lake are finished,
a wire cable is taken ashore and made fast to some tree or other safe
anchorage, the capstan on its forward deck is revolved by steam and
the "alligator" hauls itself out of the water across lots to the next
lake and begins work there.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[page&nbsp;29]</span>

<p>The greatest improvement in water transportation is the giant
raft, Fig. 30. When such a raft is made up, logs of uniform length
are placed together, the width of the raft being from sixty to one
hundred feet and its length, one thousand feet or more. It may contain
a million board feet of timber. The different sections are placed
end to end, and long boom sticks, i.&nbsp;e., logs sixty to seventy feet
long, are placed around them to bind the different sections together,
and finally the whole mass is heavily chained. Such a raft has been
towed across the Pacific.</p>

<h2>Chapter II.</h2>

<h3>SAWMILLING.</h3>


<p>The principal saws in a mill are of three kinds, the circular, Fig.
32, the gang, Fig. 33, and the band, Fig. 34. The circular-saw, tho
very rapid, is the most wasteful because of the wide kerf, and of
course the larger the saw the thicker it is and the wider the kerf.
The waste in sawdust is about
one-fifth of the log. In order
to lessen this amount two
smaller saws, one hung directly
above the other, have been used.
One saws the lower half of the
log and the other the upper
half. In this way, it is possible
to cut very large logs with the
circular-saw and with less waste.
The circular-saw is not a perfectly
flat disc, but when at rest
is slightly convex on one side
and concave on the other. This
fullness can be pushed back and
forth as can the bottom of an
oil-can. When moving at a high
rate of speed, however, the saw flattens itself by centrifugal force.
This enables it to cut straight with great accuracy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/032-407.png" width="407" height="450" alt="Fig. 32. Double Circular-Saw and Carriage." /><br /><br />Fig. 32.
Double Circular-Saw and Carriage.</div>

<p>A gang-saw is simply a series of straight saw-blades set in a vertical
frame. This has a reciprocating motion, enabling it to cut a
log into a number of boards at one time. It has this drawback, that
it must cut the size of lumber for which it is set; that is, the sawyer
has no choice in cutting the thickness, but it is very economical, wasting
only one-eighth of the log in sawdust. A special form is the flooring
gang. It consists of a number of saws placed one inch apart.
Thick planks are run thru it to saw up flooring.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[page&nbsp;31]</span>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/033-562.png" width="562" height="450" alt="Fig. 33. Gang-Saw." /><br /><br />Fig. 33. Gang-Saw.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/034-600.png" width="600" height="368" alt="Fig. 34. Band-Saw." /><br /><br />Fig. 34. Band-Saw.</div>

<p>The band-saw is fast displacing the other two, wherever it can
be used. It cuts with great rapidity and the kerf is narrow. When
first used it could not be depended upon to cut straight, but by utilizing
the same
principle that
is used in the
circular-saw, of
putting the cutting
edge under
great tension
by making
it slightly
shorter than
the middle of
the saw, it now
cuts with great
accuracy. Band-saws
are now
made up to 12
inches wide, 50
feet long, and
run at the rate of 10,000 feet a minute. They are even made with the
cutting teeth on both edges, so that the log can be sawed both going
and coming. This idea was unsuccessful until the invention of the
telescopic band-mill, Fig. 35. In this the entire mechanism carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[page&nbsp;32]</span>
the wheels on which the
band-saw revolves can be moved
up and down, so as to bring the
point where the saw leaves the
upper wheel as close to the top
of the different sized logs as
possible.</p>

<p>The usual modern mill is a
two story building, Fig. 37, built
at a convenient locality both for
receiving the logs and for shipping
the lumber. Whether the
logs arrive by water or by rail,
they are, if possible, stored in
a mill-pond until used in order
to prevent checking, discoloration,
decay, and worm attack.
From the pond they are hauled
up out of the water on to a "jack-ladder," by means of an endless
chain, provided with saddles or spurs which engage the logs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[page&nbsp;33]</span>
draw them up into the second story on to the log slip, Fig. 36.</p>

Fig. 39. Log-Stop and Loader. By letting steam into the cylinder, the projecting arm revolves, rolling one log over onto the carriage and holding the next one till wanted.</div>

<p>After the logs have entered the mill, they are inspected for stones
lodged in the bark, and for spikes left by the river men, and then
measured. Under the log-slip
is the steam "flipper"
or "kicker," Fig. 38, by means
of which the scaler or his assistant,
throwing a lever, causes
the log to be kicked over to one
side or the other, on to the log-deck,
an inclined floor sloping
toward the saw-carriage. Down
this the log rolls until stopped
by a log-stop, or log-loader, Fig.
39, a double-aimed projection,
which prevents it from rolling
on the carriage till wanted.
This stop is also worked by steam. By letting the steam into the
cylinder which controls it, one log is rolled over on the carriage and
the next one held. The log on the carriage is at once "dogged," that
is, clamped tight by iron dogs, the carriage is set for the proper cut,
and moves forward to the saw
which cuts off the first slab.
The carriage is then "gigged"
or reversed. This operation offsets
the carriage one-eighth of
an inch so that the log returns
entirely clear of the saw. In
the same way two or three 1"
boards are taken off, the dogs
are then knocked out, and the
log canted over half a revolution.
This is done by means of
the "steam nigger," Fig. 40, a
long, perpendicular toothed bar
which comes up thru the floor,
engages the log, and turns it
over till the sawn side comes up
against the knees of the carriage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[page&nbsp;35]</span>
The log is dogged again and a second slab and several boards
are taken off. The log or "stock" as it is now called, is 10", 12",
14", or 16" thick; the "nigger" then gives it a quarter-turn, leaving
it lying on a sawn side. It is dogged again, and all sawn up
except enough to make a few boards. This last piece is given a half-turn,
bringing the sawn side against the knees, and it is sawn up.
Each board as
it is sawn off
is thrown by
the board-flipper
or cant-flipper,<sup>2</sup>
Fig. 41,
on to the "live
rollers," which
take it to the
next process.
Another log
comes on the
carriage and
the process is
repeated.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 2: A "cant" is a squared or partly squared log.</p>

<p>As the sawn
boards fall off the log, they land on "live," that is, revolving rollers,
which carry them along at the rate of 200 to 250 feet a minute.
Stops are provided farther along to stop the boards wherever wanted,
as at the edger, Fig. 43, or the slasher. From the live rollers the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[page&nbsp;36]</span>
boards are transferred
automatically,
Fig. 44, by chains
running at right angles
to the rollers
and brought within
reach of the edger
man. About one-third
of the boards
of a log have rough
edges, and are called
"waney." These must
go thru the edger to
make their edges
parallel. The edger
man works with
great speed. He sees
at once what can be
made out of a board,
places it in position and runs it thru. From
the edger the boards are carried to the trimmer,
which cuts the length. The lumberman's
rule is to "cut so that you can cut
again." The so-called 16' logs are really 16'
6". The trimmer, Fig. 45, now trims these
boards to 16' 1", so that if desired they can still be cut again. The
trimmer may be set to cut at any desired length
according to the specifications.</p>

<p>The boards are now graded as to quality
into No. 1, No. 2, etc., Fig. 46,
and run out of the mill, to be
stacked up in piles, Fig. 47. Big
timbers go directly from the saw
on the rolls to the back end of
the mill, where the first end is
trimmed by a butting-saw or cut-off-saw
which swings, Fig. 48.
The timber is then shoved along
on dead rolls and the last end


<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[page&nbsp;39]</span>
trimmed by the butting-saw to a definite length as specified, and
shoved out.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features of the modern mill is its
speed. From the time the log appears till the last piece of it goes
racing out of the mill, hardly
more than a minute may have
elapsed.</p>

Cut-off-Saw. This saw trims the ends of timbers.</div>

<p>A large part of the problem
of sawmilling is the disposal
of the waste. The first of these
is the sawdust. In all first
class mills, this together with
shavings (if a planing-mill is
combined) is burned for fuel.
It is sucked up from the machines
and carried in large
tubes to the boiler-room and
there is mechanically supplied
to the fires. The slabs, once
considered as waste, contain much material that is now utilized.
From the live rolls, on which all the material falls from the main
band-saw, the slabs are carried off by transfer chains, and by another
set of five rollers to the "slasher," Fig. 50, which consists of a line
of circular-saws placed 4' 1"
apart. This slasher cuts up the
slabs into lengths suitable for
lath or fence-pickets, Fig. 49. Or
they can be resawn into 16"
lengths for shingles or fire-wood.</p>

<p>From the "slasher" the 4' 1"
lengths are carried on by traveling
platforms, chains, etc., to
the lath-machines, Fig. 51, where
they are sawn up, counted as
sawn, bound in bundles of 100,
trimmed to exactly 4' in length
and sent off to be stored. The shingle bolts are picked off the moving
platforms by men or boys, and sent to the shingle-machine, Fig.
52, where they are sawn into shingles and dropped down-stairs to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[page&nbsp;41]</span>
be packed. Shingle-bolts are also made from crooked or otherwise
imperfect logs.</p>

<p>Of what is left, a good part goes into the grinder or "hog," Fig.
53, which chews up all sorts of refuse into small chips suitable for
fuel to supplement the sawdust if necessary. Band-saws make so

<p>Boards ordinarily sawn from logs are "slash-sawn," i.&nbsp;e., they
are tangential or bastard, each cut parallel to the previous one. By
this process, only the central boards would be radial or "rift" boards.</p>

<p>But, for a number of reasons, radial boards are better. They warp
less because the annual rings cross the board more evenly. Yellow
pine flooring that is rift-sawn
is more valuable than
slash-sawn, because the edge
of the annual rings makes a
more even grain, Fig. 55. Where
slash-grained flooring is used,
the boards should be laid so
that the outside of each board
will be up in order that the inner
rings may not "shell out."</p>

<h2><span class="sc">Chapter III.</span></h2>

<h3>SEASONING.</h3>


<p>The seasoning of wood is important for several reasons. It reduces
weight, it increases strength, it prevents changes in volume
after it is worked into shape, and it prevents checking and decay.
Decay can also be prevented by submergence and burying, if by so
doing logs are kept from fungal attacks. The piles of the Swiss
Lake dwellings, which are in a state of good preservation, are of
prehistoric age. Wood under water lasts longer than steel or iron
under water. But for almost all purposes wood has to be dried in
order to be preserved. The wood is cut up, when green, to as thin
pieces as will be convenient for its use later, for the rate of drying
depends largely upon the shape and size of the piece, an inch board
drying more than four times as fast as a four inch plank, and more
than twenty times as fast as a ten inch timber.</p>

<p>There are various methods of seasoning:</p>

<p>(1) Natural or air-seasoning is the most common, and in some
respects the best. In this method, the wood is carefully and regularly
piled in the seasoning-yard, so as to be protected as far as possible
from sun and rain, but with air circulating freely on all sides
of the boards, Fig. 47, see <a class="index" href="#page38">p. 38</a>. To accomplish this, "sticking" is
employed, i.&nbsp;e., strips of wood are placed crosswise close to the ends
and at intervals between the boards. In this way the weight of the
superposed boards tends to keep those under them from warping. The
pile is skidded a foot or two off the ground and is protected above by a
roof made of boards so laid that the rain will drain off.</p>

<p>Fire-wood is best dried rapidly so that it will check, making air
spaces which facilitate ignition, but lumber needs to be slowly dried
in cool air so that the fibers may accommodate themselves to the
change of form and the wood check as little as possible. Good air-drying
consumes from two to six years, the longer the better.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[page&nbsp;46]</span>

<p>(2) Kiln-drying or hot-air-seasoning is a much more rapid process
than air-seasoning and is now in common use, Fig. 57. The
drying is also more complete, for while air-dried wood retains from
10% to 20% of moisture, kiln-dried wood may have no more than
5% as it comes from the kiln. It will, however, reabsorb some
moisture from the air, when exposed to it.</p>

<p>The wood of conifers, with its very regular structure, dries and
shrinks more evenly and much more rapidly than the wood of broad-leaved
trees, and hence is often put into the kiln without previous
air-drying, and dried in a week or even less time.</p>

<p>Oak is the most difficult wood to dry properly. When it and
other hardwoods are rapidly dried without sufficient surrounding
moisture, the wood "case-hardens," that is, the outer part dries and
shrinks before the interior has had a chance to do the same, and this
forms a shell or case of shrunken, and often checked wood around
the interior which also checks later. This interior checking is called
honeycombing. Hardwood lumber is commonly air-dried from two
to six months, before being kiln-dried. For the sake of economy in
time, the tendency is to eliminate yard-drying, and substitute kiln-drying.
Kiln-drying of one inch oak, takes one or two weeks, quarter-sawn
boards taking one and a half times as long as plain-sawn.</p>

<p>The best method of drying is that which gradually raises the temperature
of both the wood and of the water which it contains to the
point at which the drying is to take place. Care is therefore taken
not to let the surface become entirely dry before the internal moisture
is heated. This is done by retaining the moisture first vaporized
about the wood, by means of wet steam. When the surface is made
permeable to moisture, drying may take place rapidly. Curtains of
canvas are hung all around the lumber on the same principle that
windows in newly plastered buildings are hung with muslin. The
moisture is absorbed on the inner surface of the curtain and evaporates
from the outer surface. Improvements in kiln-drying are along
the line of moist air operation. In common practice, however, the
moist air principle is often neglected.</p>

<p>There are two methods in operation, the progressive method and
the charge method. In the progressive, the process is continuous,
the loads going in at one end of the kiln, and out at the other, the
temperature and the moisture being so distributed in the kiln, that
in passing from the green to the dry end, a load of lumber is first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[page&nbsp;47]</span>
moistened, then heated, and finally dried out. In the charge system,
the process is intermittent, one charge being removed before a new
one is admitted. This gives the best results with high grade lumber
for special uses.</p>

<p>A modification of hot-air-seasoning is that which subjects the
wood to a moderate heat in a moist atmosphere charged with the
products of the combustion of fuel.</p>

<p>(3) Small pieces of wood may be effectively seasoned by being
boiled in water and then dried. The process seems to consist of dissolving
out albuminous substances and thus allowing freer evaporation.
Its effect is probably weakening.</p>

<p>(4) Soaking in water is sometimes used as a good preparation
for air-seasoning. Previous soaking hastens seasoning. River men
insist that timber is improved by rafting. It is a common practice
to let cypress logs soak in the swamps where they grow for several
months before they are "mined out." They are eagerly sought after
by joiners and carpenters, because their tendency to warp is lessened.
Ebony is water-soaked in the island of Mauritius as soon as cut.
Salt water renders wood harder, heavier, and more durable and is
sometimes applied to ship timbers, but cannot be used with timbers
intended for ordinary purposes, as the presence of salt tends to absorb
atmospheric moisture.</p>

<p>(5) Boiling in oil is resorted to for special purposes, both for
preservation and to give strength. For example, the best handscrews
are so treated. The oil also prevents glue from sticking, the most
frequent cause of injury to handscrews.</p>

<p>(6) There are a number of "impregnation" methods of preserving
timber, and their practice is spreading rapidly. Of the various
preservative processes, those using coal tar creosote and zinc chloride
have proved most efficient. The purpose is to force the preservative
into the pores of the wood, either by painting, soaking, or putting under
pressure. Such impregnation methods double or treble the life
of railway ties. It is now being used with great success to preserve
electric wire poles, mine-props, piling, fence-posts, etc.</p>

<p>Wood preservation has three great advantages, it prolongs the life
of timbers in use, reduces their cost, and makes possible the use of
species that once were considered worthless. For example, the cheap
and abundant loblolly pine can be made, by preservative methods, to
take the place of high priced long-leaf pine for many purposes.</p>

<h4>PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR STORING LUMBER.</h4>

<p>Under the hasty methods prevalent in the mill, very little wood
comes to the shop well seasoned, and it should therefore be carefully
stored before using, so as to have the fullest possible air circulation
around it. Where the boards are large enough, "sticking" is the best
method of storage, i.&nbsp;e., narrow strips of wood are placed at short
intervals between the pieces which are piled flat. The weight of the
boards themselves helps to prevent warping. Boards set upright or
on edge are likely to be distorted soon. It is often wise to press together
with weights or to clamp together with handscrews boards
that show a tendency to warp,
putting the two concave sides
together. Then the convex
side is exposed and the board
may straighten thus: Fig. 58.
By wrapping up small boards
in paper or cloth in the intervals
between work on them,
they may be kept straight until
they are assembled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><img src="images/058-500.png" width="500" height="273" alt="Fig. 58. Clamping up Boards to Prevent Warping." /><br /><br />Fig. 58. Clamping up Boards to Prevent Warping.</div>


<p>Another precaution to take is to be sure to plane both sides of a
board if either is planed, especially if the board has been exposed to
air-drying for some time.</p>


<h4 style="margin-top: 3em;">WOOD MEASUREMENTS.</h4>

<p>Lumber is a general term for all kinds of sawn wood. Logs may
be sawn into timber, that is, beams and joists, into planks, which
are 2" to 4" thick, or into boards which are from &frac14;" to 1&frac34;" thick.
These may be resawn into special sizes.</p>

<p>Lumber is measured by the superficial foot, which is a board 1"
thick, 12" wide, and 12" long, so that a board 1" thick, (or &#8542;"
dressed) 6" wide and 12' 0" long, measures 6' B. M. (board measure).
Boards 1" or more thick are sold by the "board foot" which is equivalent
to 12" square and 1" thick. Boards less than 1" thick are sold
by the square foot, face measure. Dressed lumber comes in sizes &#8539;"
less than sawn lumber. Regular sizes are:</p>

</table>






<p>Any of these may be dressed down to thinner boards, or resawn
on a special band-saw.</p>

<p>In ordering it is common to give the dimensions wanted, in the
order of thickness, width, and length, because that is the order in
which dimensions are gotten out. E. g.:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>6 pcs. quar. oak, &#8542;" &times; 6" &times; 3'0"</p>
<p>2 pcs. quar. oak, &frac34;" &times; 7&frac12;" &times; 15"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>If a piece wanted is short the way the grain goes, the order would
be the same, thus: &frac34;" &times; 11" (wide) &times; 6" (long). That is, "long"
means the way the grain runs. It is always safe to specify in such a
case. It is common when small pieces are ordered to add one-quarter
to the cost for waste.</p>

<p>In large lots lumber is ordered thus: 800' (B. M.) whitewood,
dressed 2 sides to &#8542;", 10" and up. This means that the width of any
piece must not be less than 10". Prices are usually given per "M,"
i.&nbsp;e., per 1000 ft.: e. g.: basswood may be quoted at $40.00 per M.</p>

<p>When thin boards are desired it is often economical to buy inch
stuff and have it resawn.</p>

<p>Some lumber is also ordered by the "running" or lineal foot, especially
moldings, etc., or by the piece, if there is a standard size
as in fence-posts, studs, etc. Laths and shingles are ordered by the
bundle to cover a certain area. 1000 4" shingles (= 4 bundles) cover
110 sq. ft. with 4" weather exposure. 100 laths (1 bundle) each
&frac14;" &times; 1&frac12;" &times; 4'0" cover about 150 sq. ft.</p>

<p>There are several methods of measuring lumber. The general rule
is to multiply the length in feet by the width and thickness in inches
and divide by 12, thus: 1" &times; 6" &times; 15' &divide; 12 = 7&frac12; feet. The use of the
Essex board-measure and the Lumberman's board-measure are described
in Chapter 4, <a class="index" href="#page109">pp. 109</a> and <a class="index" href="#page111">111</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">Chapter IV.</span></h2>

<h3>WOOD HAND TOOLS.</h3>


<p>The hand tools in common use in woodworking shops may, for
convenience, be divided into the following classes: 1, Cutting; 2,
Boring; 3, Chopping; 4, Scraping; 5, Pounding; 6, Holding; 7,
Measuring and Marking; 8, Sharpening; 9, Cleaning.</p>


<h4>1. CUTTING TOOLS.</h4>

<p>The most primitive as well as the simplest of all tools for the
dividing of wood into parts, is the wedge. The wedge does not even
cut the wood, but only crushes enough of it with its edge to allow
its main body to split the wood apart. As soon as the split has begun,
the edge of the wedge serves no further purpose, but the sides
bear against the split surfaces of the wood. The split runs ahead of
the wedge as it is driven along until the piece is divided.</p>

<p>It was by means of the wedge that primitive people obtained
slabs of wood, and the great change from primitive to civilized methods
in manipulating wood consists in the substitution of cutting for
splitting, of edge tools for the wedge. The wedge follows the grain
of the wood, but the edge tool can follow a line determined by the
worker. The edge is a refinement and improvement upon the wedge
and enables the worker to be somewhat independent of the natural
grain of the wood.</p>

<p>In general, it may be said that the function of all cutting tools
is to separate one portion of material from another along a definite
path. All such tools act, first, by the keen edge dividing the material
into two parts; second, by the wedge or the blade forcing these two
portions apart. If a true continuous cut is to be made, both of these
actions must occur together. The edge must be sharp enough to
enter between the small particles of material, cutting without bruising
them, and the blade of the tool must constantly force apart the two
portions in order that the cutting action of the edge may continue.</p>

<p>The action of an ax in splitting wood is not a true cut, for only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[page&nbsp;52]</span>
the second process is taking place, Fig. 59. The split which opens
in front of the cutting edge anticipates its cutting and therefore the
surfaces of the opening are rough and torn.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/059-276.png" width="276" height="344" alt="Fig. 59. Wedge Action." /><br /><br />Fig. 59. Wedge Action.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/060-296.png" width="296" height="344" alt="Fig. 60. Edge Action." /><br /><br />Fig. 60. Edge Action.</div>

<p>When a knife or chisel is
pressed into a piece of wood at
right angles to the grain, and
at some distance from the end
of the wood, as in Fig. 60, a
continuous cutting action is
prevented, because soon the
blade cannot force apart the
sides of the cut made by the
advancing edge, and the knife
is brought to rest. In this case,
it is practically only the first action which has taken place.</p>

<p>Both the actions, the cutting and the splitting, must take place
together to produce a true continuous cut. The edge must always be
in contact with the solid material, and the blade must always be
pushing aside the portions which have been cut. This can happen
only when the material on one side of the blade is thin enough and
weak enough to be readily bent out of the way without opening a
split in front of the cutting edge. This cutting action may take
place either along the grain, Fig. 61, or across it, Fig. 62.</p>

<p>The bending aside of the shaving will require less force the
smaller the taper of the wedge. On the other hand, the wedge must
be strong enough to sustain the bending resistance and also to support
the cutting edge. In other
words, the more acute the cutting
edge, the easier the work,
and hence the wedge is made as
thin as is consistent with
strength. This varies all the
way from hollow ground razors
to cold-chisels. For soft
wood, the cutting angle (or
bevel, or bezel) of chisels,
gouges and plane-irons, is small, even as low as 20&deg;; for hard wood,
it must be greater. For metals, it varies from 54&deg; for wrought iron
to 66&deg; for gun metal.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/061-300.png" width="300" height="243" alt="Fig. 61. Edge and Wedge Action With the Grain." /><br /><br />Fig. 61. Edge and Wedge Action With the Grain.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/062-267.png" width="267" height="243" alt="Fig. 62. Edge and Wedge Action Across the Grain." /><br /><br />Fig. 62. Edge and Wedge Action Across the Grain.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[page&nbsp;53]</span>

<p>Ordinarily a cutting tool should be so applied that the face nearest
the material lies as nearly as possible in the direction of the cut
desired, sufficient clearance being necessary to insure contact of the
actual edge.</p>

<p>There are two methods of using edge tools: one, the chisel or
straight cut, by direct pressure; the other, the knife or sliding cut.</p>

<p>The straight cut, Fig. 63, takes place
when the tool is moved into the material
at right angles to the cutting edge.
Examples are: the action of metalworking
tools and planing machines,
rip-sawing, turning, planing (when the
plane is held parallel to the edge of the
board being planed), and chiseling,
when the chisel is pushed directly in
line with its length.</p>

<p>The knife or sliding cut, Fig. 64,
takes place when the tool is moved forward
obliquely to its cutting edge,
either along or across the grain. It is
well illustrated in cutting soft materials,
such as bread, meat, rubber, cork,
etc. It is an advantage in delicate chiseling and gouging. That this
sliding action is easier than the straight pressure can easily be proved
with a penknife on thin wood, or by planing with the plane held at
an angle to, rather than in line with, the direction of the planing
motion. The edge of the cutter then slides into the material.
The reason why the sliding cut is easier, is partly because the angle
of the bevel with the wood is reduced by holding the tool obliquely,
and partly because even the sharpest cutting edge is notched with
very fine teeth all along its edge so that in the sliding cut it acts
like a saw. In an auger-bit, both methods of cutting take place at
once. The scoring nib cuts with a sliding cut, while the cutting lip
is thrust directly into the wood.</p>

<p>The chisel and the knife, one with the edge on the end, and the
other with the edge on the side, are the original forms of all modern
cutting tools.</p>

<p>The <i>chisel</i> was at first only a chipped stone, then it came to be a
ground stone, later it was made of bronze, and still later of iron, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[page&nbsp;54]</span>
now it is made of steel. In its early form it is known by paleontologists
as a celt, and at first had no handle, but later developed
into the ax and adze for chopping and hewing, and the chisel for
cuts made by driving and paring. It is quite likely that the celt
itself was simply a development of the wedge.</p>

<p>In the modern chisel, all the grinding is done on one side. This
constitutes the essential feature of the chisel, namely, that the back
of the blade is kept perfectly flat and the face is ground to a bevel.
Blades vary in width from <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span> inch to 2 inches. Next to the blade
on the end of which is the cutting edge, is the shank, Fig. 65. Next,
as in socketed
chisels, there
is the socket
to receive the
handle, or, in
tanged chisels,
a shoulder and
four-sided
tang which is
driven into
the handle, which is bound at its lower end by a ferrule. The handle
is usually made of apple wood.</p>

<p>The most familiar form is the <i>firmer-chisel</i>, Fig. 65, which is said
to get its name from the fact that it is firmer or stiffer than the
paring-chisel. (See below.) The firmer-chisel
is a general utility tool, being
suited for hand pressure or mallet
pounding, for paring or for light mortising.</p>

<p>Different varieties of chisels are
named; (1) according to their uses; as
paring-chisels, framing-chisels, mortise-chisels,
carving-chisels, turning-chisels,
etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/066-68-326.png" width="326" height="450" alt="Fig. 66. Paring-Chisel. Fig. 67. Framing-Chisel. Fig. 68. Mortise-Chisel." /><br /><br />Fig. 66. Paring-Chisel. &nbsp;Fig. 67. Framing-Chisel. &nbsp;Fig. 68. Mortise-Chisel.</div>

<p>The <i>paring-chisel</i>, Fig. 66, has a
handle specially shaped to give control
over its movements, and a long thin
blade, which in the best form is beveled
on the two edges to facilitate grooving.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[page&nbsp;55]</span>
It is intended only for steady pressure with the hand and not for use
with a mallet.</p>

<p>The <i>framing-chisel</i>, Fig. 67, is thick and heavy and was formerly
much used in house framing. It is usually made with the handle
fitting into a socket on the shank, in order to withstand the shock of
heavy blows from the mallet.</p>

<p>The <i>mortise-chisel</i>, Fig. 68,
is made abnormally thick to
give the stiffness necessary for
levering the waste out of
mortises.</p>

<p>(2) Chisels are also named
according to their shapes:
as, skew-chisels, corner-chisels,
round-nosed chisels, etc.</p>

<p>The angle of the bevel of a
chisel is determined by the kind
of wood for which it is most
used, hard wood requiring a
wider angle than soft wood, in. For
order to support the edge
ordinary work, the bevel is correctly ground to an angle of about 20&deg;.
The chisel is a necessary tool in making almost every kind of joint.
It may almost be said that one mark of a good workman is his preference
for the chisel. Indeed an excellent motto for the woodworker
is: "When in doubt, use a chisel".</p>

<p>In general, there are two uses for the chisel (1), when it is driven
by a push with the hand, as in paring, and (2), when it is driven
by blows of a mallet, as in digging mortises.</p>

<p>In relation to the grain of the wood, it is used in three directions:
(1) longitudinally, that is with the grain, called paring; (2) laterally,
across the surface, called cutting sidewise; (3) transversely, that is
across the end, called cutting end-wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/069-650.png"><img src="images/069-462.png" width="462" height="450" alt="Fig. 69. Paring with a Chisel." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 69. Paring with a Chisel.</div>

<p>1. <i>Paring</i>. To remove shavings rapidly, the chisel is held flat
side up, the handle grasped by the right hand, with the thumb
pointing toward the shank, and the blade held in the left hand, as
in Fig. 69. Held in this way great control can be exerted and much
force applied. For paring the surface as flat and smooth as possible,
the chisel should be reversed, that is, held so that the flat side will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[page&nbsp;56]</span>
act as a guide. Held in this way the chisel has no equal for paring
except the plane. Paring with the chisel is the method used in
cutting stop chamfers. (See <a class="index" href="#page185">p. 185</a>, Chapter VIII.) By holding
the cutting edge obliquely to
the direction of the grain and
of the cut, the effective "sliding
cut" is obtained, Fig. 64.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a href="images/070-700.png"><img src="images/070-300.png" width="300" height="270" alt="Fig. 70. Chiseling Out a Dado. (First Step)." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 70. Chiseling Out a Dado. (First Step).</div>

<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p>2. In <i>sidewise chiseling</i> the chisel is held in the same manner as
in paring. A typical form of sidewise chiseling is the cutting out
of a dado, Fig. 70. The work may be placed on the bench-hook or
held in the vise with the side up
from which the groove is to be cut.
The chisel is pushed directly across
the grain, the blade being somewhat
inclined to the upper surface so as
to cut off a corner next the saw
kerf. After a few cuts thus made
with the chisel inclined alternately
both ways, the ridge thus formed is
taken off, Fig. 71. In this way the
surface is lowered to the required
depth. If more force be required,
the palm of the hand may be used
as a mallet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="margin-top: 2em;"><a href="images/072-450.png"><img src="images/072-257.png" width="257" height="450" alt="Fig. 72. Perpendicular Chiseling." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 72. Perpendicular Chiseling.</div>

<p>3. In <i>chiseling end-wood</i>, it is
well, if possible, to rest the piece to
be trimmed flat on the cutting board
or on a piece of waste wood. Work
done in this way is often called perpendicular
chiseling, Fig.72. The
handle is grasped in the right hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[page&nbsp;57]</span>
thumb up, while the blade of the chisel passes between the thumb and
first finger of the left hand, the back of which rests on the work and
holds it in place. As the right hand pushes the chisel downwards the
thumb and first finger of the left hand control its motion. When chiseling
it is well to stand so as to look along
the line being cut. Incline the chisel toward
you, and use the near part of the
cutting edge for a guide and the farther
corner for cutting, pushing the handle both
down and forward at the same time, Fig.
73. Or, by pushing the chisel sidewise with
the thumb of the left hand at the same
time that the right hand pushes it downward,
the effective sliding cut is obtained.</p>

<p>End chiseling requires considerable
force and therefore only thin shavings should be cut off at a
time. Or the mallet may
be used with caution. In
order to leave a smooth
surface the chisel must
be very sharp. Even then
the lower arris (corner)
is likely to be splintered
off. This can be
prevented by clamping
the work down tight with a handscrew
to a perfectly smooth cutting board. It
is often advisable however, to set the
piece upright in the vise and pare off
thin shavings horizontally, Fig. 74. In
rounding a corner, both this and perpendicular
chiseling are common methods.
In both cases care should be taken
to cut from the side toward the end
and not into the grain, lest the piece
split, Fig. 75. In horizontal end paring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[page&nbsp;58]</span>
Fig. 74, in order to prevent splintering,
it is well to trim down the arrises
diagonally to the line and then to reduce
the rest of the end surface.</p>

<p>In all hand chiseling, it is a wise
precaution not to try to cut out much
material at each stroke but to work
back gradually to the line.</p>
<br clear="all" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 185px;"><a href="images/076-400.png"><img src="images/076-184.png" width="184" height="450" alt="Fig. 76. Mallet Chiseling." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 76. Mallet Chiseling. <br />The Piece is Clamped Down on the Bench With the Bench Hook.</div>

<p>A typical form of mallet chiseling is
the digging of a mortise, Fig. 76. (See
also <a class="index" href="#page56">p. 56</a>.) The chisel is held perpendicular
in the left hand, while the right
hand drives blows with the mallet. The
hammer should never be used. (See
mallet, <a class="index" href="#page96">p. 96</a>.) By rocking the chisel
and at the same time giving it a twisting
motion while the edge is kept on the
wood, the edge can be stepped to the
exact place desired. Care should be
taken to work back to the lines gradually,
to cut only part way thru from
each side (in the case of a thru mortise-and-tenon),
and to keep the cut
faces perpendicular to the surfaces.</p>

<p>In sharpening a chisel it is of first importance that the back be
kept perfectly flat. The bevel is first ground on the grindstone
to an angle of about 20&deg;
and great care should be
taken to keep the edge
straight and at right angles
to the sides of the blade.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/077-476.png" width="476" height="450" alt="Fig. 77. Whetting a Plane-Bit." /><br /><br />Fig. 77 Whetting a Plane-Bit.</div>

<p>After grinding it is necessary
to whet the chisel
and other edged tools. (See
also under oilstones, <a class="index" href="#page121">p. 121</a>.)
First see that there is
plenty of oil on the stone.
If an iron box be used, Fig.
77, the oil is obtained simply
by turning the stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[page&nbsp;59]</span>
over, for it rests on a pad of felt which is kept wet with kerosene.</p>

<p>Place the beveled edge flat on the stone, feeling to see if it does
lie flat, then tip up the chisel and rub it at an angle slightly more
obtuse than that which it was ground, Fig. 78. The more nearly the
chisel can be whetted at the angle
at which it was ground the
better. In rubbing, use as
much of the stone as possible,
so as to wear it down evenly.
The motion may be back and
forth or spiral, but in either
case it should be steady and not
rocking. This whetting turns a light wire edge over on the flat side.
In order to remove this wire edge, the back of the chisel, that is, the
straight, unbeveled side, is held perfectly flat on the whetstone and
rubbed, then it is turned over and the bevel rubbed again on the stone.
It is necessary to reverse the chisel in this way a number of times, in
order to remove the wire edge, but the chisel should never be tipped
so as to put any bevel at all on its flat side. Finally, the edge is
touched up (stropped) by being drawn over a piece of leather a few
times, first on one side, then on the other, still continuing to hold
the chisel so as to keep the bevel perfect.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/078-500.png" width="500" height="172" alt="Fig. 78. Grinding Angle, 20°;. Whetting Angle, 25°." /><br /><br />Fig. 78. Grinding Angle, 20&deg;. Whetting Angle, 25&deg;.</div>

<p>To test the sharpness of a whetted edge,
draw the tip of the finger or thumb lightly
along it, Fig. 79. If the edge be dull, it will
feel smooth: if it be sharp, and if care be
taken, it will score the skin a little, not
enough to cut thru, but just enough to be felt.</p>

<p>The <i>gouge</i> is a form of chisel, the blade
of which is concave, and hence the edge
curved. When the bevel is on the outside,
the common form, it is called an outside bevel
gouge or simply a "gouge," Fig. 80; if the
bevel is on the inside, it is called an inside
bevel, or inside ground, or scribing-gouge, or paring-gouge, Fig. 81.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 3: Another confusing nomenclature (Goss) gives the name "inside gouges"
to those with the cutting edge on the inside, and "outside gouges" to those
with the cutting edge on the outside.</p>

<p>Carving tools are, properly speaking, all
chisels, and are of different shapes for facility in
carving.</p>

<p>For ordinary gouging, Fig. 82, the blade is
gripped firmly by the left hand with the knuckles
up, so that a strong control can be exerted
over it. The gouge is manipulated in much the
same way as the chisel, and like the chisel it is
used longitudinally, laterally, and transversely.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/082-529.png" width="529" height="450"  alt="Fig. 82. Gouging." /><br /><br />Fig. 82. Gouging.</div>

<p>In working with the grain, by twisting the
blade on its axis as it moves forward, delicate
paring cuts may be made. This is particularly
necessary in working cross-grained wood, and is
a good illustration of the advantage of the sliding
cut.</p>

<p>In gouging out broad surfaces like trays or
saddle seats it will be found of great advantage
to work laterally, that is across the surface, especially in even grained
woods as sweet gum. The tool is not so likely to slip off and run in
as when working with the grain.</p>

<p>The gouge that is commonly used for cutting concave outlines
on end grain, is the inside bevel gouge. Like the chisel in cutting
convex outlines, it is pushed or driven perpendicularly thru the
wood laid flat on a cutting board on the bench, as in perpendicular
chiseling, Fig. 72. <a class="index" href="#page56">p. 56</a>.</p>

<p>In sharpening an outside bevel gouge, the main bevel is obtained
on the grindstone, care being taken to keep the gouge rocking on its
axis, so as to get an even curve.
It is then whetted on the flat
side of a slipstone, Fig. 83, the
bevel already obtained on the
grindstone being made slightly
more obtuse at the edge. A good
method is to rock the gouge on
its axis with the left hand, while
the slipstone held in the right
hand is rubbed back and forth on
the edge. Then the concave side
is rubbed on the round edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[page&nbsp;61]</span>
the slipstone, care being taken
to avoid putting a bevel on it.
Inside bevel gouges need to be
ground on a carborundum or
other revolving stone having a
round edge. The outfit of the
agacite grinder, (Fig. 224,
<a class="index" href="#page120">p. 120</a>), contains one of these
stones. The whetting, of
course, is the reverse of that
on the outside bevel gouge.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/084-137.png" width="137" height="450" alt="Fig. 84. Sloyd Knife." /><br /><br />Fig. 84. Sloyd Knife.</div>

<p>The <i>knife</i> differs from the
chisel in two respects, (1) the
edge is along the side instead
of the end, and (2) it has a
two-beveled edge. Knives are
sometimes made with one side
flat for certain kinds of paring work, but these are uncommon. The
two-beveled edge is an advantage to the worker in enabling him to
cut into the wood at any angle, but it is a disadvantage
in that it is incapable of making flat surfaces.
The knife is particularly valuable in woodwork
for scoring and for certain emergencies. The sloyd
knife, Fig. 84, is a tool likely to be misused in the
hands of small children, but when sharp and in
strong hands, has many valuable uses. A convenient
size has a 2&frac12; inch blade. When grinding and
whetting a knife, the fact that both sides are beveled
alike should be kept in mind.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/085-300.png" width="300" height="140" alt="Fig. 85. Draw-Knife." /><br /><br />Fig. 85. Draw-Knife.</div>

<p>The <i>draw-knife</i>, Fig. 85, is ground like a chisel, with the bevel
only on one side, but the edge is along the side like a knife. Instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[page&nbsp;62]</span>
of being pushed into the wood, like a chisel, it is drawn into it by the
handles which project in advance of the cutting edge. The handles
are sometimes made to fold over the edge, and thus protect it when
not in use. The size is indicated by the length of the cutting
edge. It is particularly useful in reducing narrow surfaces and in
slicing off large pieces, but it is liable to split rather than cut the
wood.</p>
<br clear="all" />


<h4>SAWS.</h4>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/086-350.png" width="350" height="117" alt="Fig. 86. Hand Saw." /><br /><br />Fig. 86. Hand Saw.</div>

<p>The object of the saw is to cut thru
a piece of material along a determined
line. Its efficiency depends upon (1)
the narrowness of the saw cut or "kerf,"
and (2) upon the force required to drive
it thru the material. The thinner the blade, the less material will be
cut out and wasted, and the less force will have to be applied. In
order to have the saw as thin as possible, almost all the people of
the world, except the Anglo Saxons, have saws that cut when they
are pulled toward the worker. The blade is in tension while cutting
and in compression only when being returned for a new cut. German
carpenters use a saw like our turning-saw. English and Americans
have developed the saw on the opposite principle, namely, that it
should cut on the pushing stroke. As a matter of fact, the crosscut-saw
cuts somewhat on the back stroke. The pushing stroke necessitates
a thickening of the blade sufficient to prevent buckling,&mdash;a not
uncommon occurrence in the bands of a novice, in spite of this thickening.
But tho this requires more force, and involves more waste,
there are the compensations that the arm can exert more pressure in
pushing than in pulling, especially when the worker stands upright
or stoops over his work, and the stiffer wide blade acts as a guide to
the sawyer. Each method has its advantages. Whatever may be true
of hand-saws, in machine-saws the tension method, as illustrated by
the gang-saw and the band-saw, is steadily displacing the compression
method utilized in the circular-saw. Many kinds of work, however,
can be done only on the circular-saw.</p>

<p>In order to diminish the disadvantages of the thrusting stroke, the
modern hand-saw, Fig. 86, has been gradually improved as the result
of much experience and thought. The outline of the blade is
tapered in width from handle to point; it is thicker also at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[page&nbsp;63]</span>
heel (the handle end) than at the point; its thickness also tapers
from the teeth to the back. All these tapers gives stiffness where
it is most needed. It is made wide for the sake of giving steadiness
in sawing. The fact that it is thinner at the back than along
the teeth gives it clearance in passing back and forth in the kerf, but
the friction is still great, especially in sawing soft or damp wood. To
avoid this binding still further, the teeth are "set" alternately one to
one side and the next to the other, and so on.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/087-600.png" width="600" height="138" alt="Fig. 87. Rip Saw Teeth." /><br /><br />Fig. 87. Rip Saw Teeth: A-edge view, B-side view, C cross-section.
<br />Crosscut-Saw Teeth: A'-edge view, B'-side view, C'-cross-section.</div>

<p>The size of saws is indicated by the length of the blade in inches.
The coarseness of the tooth is indicated by the number of "points" to
the inch. "Points" should not be confused with teeth as there is
always one more point per inch than there are teeth. For example, a
five point rip-saw has five points to the inch but only four full teeth,
Fig. 87. Rip-saws run from 4 to 7 points per inch; crosscut-saws
from 6 to 12 points per inch.</p>

<p>In general, saws are of two kinds, rip-saws and crosscut-saws.</p>

<p>The <i>rip-saw</i>, Fig. 87, may be thought of as a series of chisels set
in two parallel rows which overlap each other, for each tooth is filed
to a sharp edge which, at each stroke, chisels off a small particle from
the end of the wood fibers.</p>

<p>The shape of the teeth is the result of experience in uniting a
number of factors: as, strength of the individual tooth, the acuteness
of the cutting angle, and the ease of sharpening. The steel of a saw
is softer than that of a chisel, in order that it may be filed and set.
Hence it is weaker and the edge cannot be so acute. A typical form
of tooth is shown in Fig. 87, in which A is an edge view, B the side
view, and C a cross section. The angle of each tooth covers 60&deg;, one
side, the "face", being at right angles to the line of the teeth. The
cutting edge runs at right angles to the sides of the blade.</p>

<p>This arrangement works with entire success along the grain, but
if a rip-saw is used to cut across the grain, since there is no provision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[page&nbsp;64]</span>
for cutting thru the fibers, each tooth catches in them and tears them
out, thus leaving a rough and jagged surface.</p>

<p>In the <i>crosscut-saw</i>, therefore, the teeth are filed to points, and
the cutting edge is on the forward side of each alternate tooth. In
Fig. 87. A' is the edge view, B' is the side view and C' is a cross-section.
In a properly filed crosscut-saw a needle will slide between
these two rows of teeth from one end of the saw to the other.</p>

<p>In action the
points, especially their
forward edges, cut or
score the fibres of
wood, and then the triangular
elevation of
wood left between the
two rows of points is
crumbled off by friction
as the saw passes
through. Thus it drops
farther and farther
into the cut. A
crosscut-saw may be
thought of as a series
of knife points, arranged
in two parallel
rows. Ordinarily the
angle of the "face" of
each tooth with the
line of the teeth is
about 65&deg;, and slightly
steeper than the back
of the tooth. The angle of the cutting edge of each tooth may be
filed more acute when the saw is to be used for soft wood only.</p>

<p>A crosscut-saw when used to rip a board, works slowly, for there
is no chisel action to cut out the fibres between the points, but the cut,
tho slow, is smooth. In cutting diagonally across a piece of wood,
especially soft wood, a rip-saw cuts faster, but a crosscut, smoother.
In ripping a board, allowance should always be made for planing
to the line afterward. In starting a cut with the rip-saw, the weight
of the saw should be borne by the right hand so that the teeth may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[page&nbsp;65]</span>
pass over the edge of the wood as lightly as possible. The left thumb
acts as a guide. If the saw be handled thus, and the angle with the
board be quite acute, it is not necessary to start with a back stroke.
When the kerf is well started, the whole weight of the saw may be
applied. An easy light stroke is better than a furious one. The line
should be followed carefully, but if the saw runs from the line it may
be brought back by taking short strokes near the point of the saw
and twisting the blade slightly in the desired direction. If the saw
binds and buckles because of the springing together of the wood, the
kerf may be wedged open with a screwdriver or a bit of waste wood.
A drop of oil rubbed across each side of the saw will make it work
more easily.</p>

<p>Care should be
taken in finishing a
cut to hold up firmly
the part of the wood
which is being sawn
off so that it will not
split off or splinter.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/088-339.png" width="339" height="450" alt="Fig. 88. Rip-Sawing on a Horse." /><br /><br />Fig. 88. Rip-Sawing on a Horse.</div>

<p>Sawing may be
done either on a saw-horse,
Fig. 88, or at
a bench. For big,
rough work, the former
is the common
way, the worker holding the material in place with one knee, because
this method enables him to exert his greatest strength. A convenient
way for rip-sawing a small piece of wood is to insert it in the vise,
Fig. 89, with the broad side of the board parallel to the vise screw,
and the board inclined away from the worker who stands upright.
The start is easy, the sawdust does not cover the line, and the board
is not in danger of splitting. The board, however, has to be reversed
after it is sawn part way thru, in order to finish the saw cut.</p>

<p>The <i>back-saw</i> or <i>tenon-saw</i>, Fig. 90. is a fine crosscut-saw, with
a rib of steel along the back, which gives to it its name. Since it is
intended for small accurate work, the teeth have little or no set.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/090-350.png" width="350" height="195" alt="Fig. 90. Using the Back-Saw with Bench-Hook." /><br /><br />Fig. 90. Using the Back-Saw with Bench-Hook.</div>

<p>In sawing, the wood may be held either in the vise or on the
bench-hook. To help start the saw and at the same time to keep
the edges of the cut sharp, it is well to make a little groove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[page&nbsp;66]</span>
with the knife, on the waste
side of the line to be followed,
cutting the side of the groove
next to the line at right angles
to the surface. The saw drops
directly into this groove, Fig.
91. In starting the saw cut,
the saw should be guided by
holding the thumb of the left
hand against the side of the
saw just above the teeth. Until the kerf is well started, the saw
should be held so that the teeth just touch the wood. It is better not
to attempt to start the saw level, i.&nbsp;e.,
with the teeth resting clear across the
wood, but the handle should be raised
so that the start is made only at the
farther edge of the wood. Then as the
saw is gradually lowered, the kerf will
extend quite across the wood, Fig. 92.
When the back-saw is used for ripping,
the wood is held in the vise, end up.
Begin sawing as in crosscutting, that is,
at the farther corner with the handle
end of the saw up, and gradually drop
the handle. Watch the lines on both
the front and back sides, and if necessary,
reverse the piece to follow them.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[page&nbsp;67]</span>

curves. The teeth are a cross between the rip and crosscut teeth. It
is used in sawing curves.</p>

<p>The <i>turning-saw</i>, Fig. 95, is a narrow saw, set in a frame, which
stretches the saw tight, so that
it works as a tension saw (cf.
<a class="index" href="#page62">p. 62</a>). The best frames are
made so that the handles which
hold the blade can revolve in
the frame. The turning-saw is
used chiefly for cutting curves.
A 14 inch blade, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>3</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span> of an inch
wide is a good size for ordinary
use. The teeth are like those
of a rip-saw, so that they are
quite likely to tear the wood in
cutting across the grain. Allowance
should be made for this
and the surplus removed with
a spokeshave. The turning-saw may be used to cut on either the
pulling or the pushing stroke, with the teeth pointed either toward
or away from the worker. The pulling cut is generally better, as it
puts less strain on the frame than the pushing cut. Both hands
should grasp the frame as near the end of the blade as possible,
Fig. 95. Turns are made by revolving the frame on the blade as an
axis, which
should always
be kept at
right angles
to the surface
of the board.
Care should
be taken not
to twist the
blade.</p>

<p><i>To file and
set a saw</i>, the
saw is first
fastened in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[page&nbsp;68]</span>
the saw-vise, Fig. 96, with the teeth up. It is then top-jointed by
running a flat file or a saw-jointer, Fig. 97, back and forth lengthwise
along the tops of the
teeth to bring them to a level.
After jointing the saw should
be set. For this purpose a saw-set.
Fig. 98, is necessary. Every
alternate tooth is bent in
the direction of its set by the
plunger in the instrument
pushing against the anvil,
which is an adjustable eccentric
disc. After the saw is set, it is filed. This is done with a triangular
file, Fig. 144, <a class="index" href="#page90">p. 90</a>, which is held in the right hand and its point in
the thumb and fingers of the left. Pressure is applied only on the
forward stroke, which should be
long and even, the file being
raised above the tooth on the
return stroke. The file should
cut in the direction of the set,
that is, the teeth having the
set away from the worker
are filed first. Every alternate
tooth, 1st. 3d, 5th, etc., is filed, and then the saw is reversed and the
other set, the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc., is filed.</p>

<br clear="all" />

<p>In filing a rip-saw the file should move exactly perpendicularly
to the plane of the saw blade, that is, directly across the teeth. The
filing is done on the back of the teeth, the file just touching the face
of the next one. The filing is continued, with one, two, or three
strokes, for each tooth, as the case may require, or just until each
tooth is sharp.</p>

<p>In filing a crosscut-saw, the file is held pointing upward and toward
the point of the saw. The file should cut in the direction of
the set. The angle of the cutting edge is determined by the horizontal
inclination of the file to the blade; the angle of the point is
determined by the perpendicular inclination of the file to the blade.
Finally the sides of the teeth are rubbed lightly with a slipstone
to remove the wire edge. It should always be remembered that a saw
is an edge tool, and its edges are as liable to injury as any edges.</p>

<h4>PLANES.</h4>

<p>The <i>plane</i> is a modified chisel. The chief difference in action
between a chisel and a plane in paring is this: the back of the chisel
lies close down on the surface of the wood that is cut, and acts as a
guide; whereas, in the plane, the cutter is elevated at an angle away
from the surface of the wood, and only its cutting edge touches the
wood, and it is held and guided mechanically by the plane mechanism.
In other words, a plane is a chisel firmly held in a device which
raises the cutter at an angle from the work, regulates the depth of
the cut, and favors the cutting rather than the splitting action. An
illustration of a chisel converted into a plane is the adjustable
<i>chisel-gage</i>,
Fig. 99.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/099-100-600.png" width="600" height="150" alt="Fig. 99. Adjustable Chisel-Gage. Fig. 100. Wooden Bench-Plane." /><br /><br />Fig. 99. Adjustable Chisel-Gage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 100. Wooden Bench-Plane.</div>

<p>The plane has developed as follows: it was first a chisel held in
a block of wood. This is all that oriental planes are now, simply a
sharpened wedge driven into a block of wood. When the hole works
too loose, the Japanese carpenter inserts a piece of paper to tighten
it, or he makes a new block. The first improvement was the addition
of a wooden wedge to hold in place the "plane-iron", as the cutter
was formerly called. In this form, the cutter or plane-iron, tho still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[page&nbsp;70]</span>
wedge-shaped, was reversed, being made heavier at the cutting edge
in order to facilitate fastening it in the wooden plane-stock by means
of the wooden wedge. Then a handle was added for convenience.
Then came the cap, the object of which is to break back the shaving
and thus weaken it as soon as possible after it is cut. Until a few
years ago, this was all that there was in a plane, and such planes are
still common, Fig. 100. Finally there appeared the iron plane, Fig.
101, with it various mechanical adjustments. The following are
the parts of the Bailey iron plane:<sup>4</sup></p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 4: The numbers and names in italics are those given in Stanley's Catalog,
No. 34. Some of these names, as "plane-iron," are survivals from the days
of the wooden plane and are obviously unsuitable now.</p>

<p>There are various principles involved in the action of the plane.
The effect of the flat sole is to regulate the cut of the cutter. If the
surface be uneven, the cutter will not cut at all, or but little, in passing
over low places, since the toe and heel of the sole will then be
resting on higher places; but when the cutter reaches a high place
a shaving will be taken off. Hence it follows that the longer the
plane, the straighter will be the surface produced. The length of the
plane used is determined by the length of the wood to be planed, and
the degree of straightness desired.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[page&nbsp;71]</span>

<p>The part of the sole directly in front of the cutter presses firmly
down on the wood and so prevents the shaving from splitting far in
advance of the edge. It follows that the narrowness of the mouth
in a plane is an important factor in the production of smooth surfaces.
This can be regulated by adjusting the toe in the block-plane,
and by moving the frog in the jack- and smooth-planes.</p>

<p>A recent improvement in jack-, smooth-, and fore-planes consists
of an adjustable frog, by means of which the throat can be narrowed
or widened at will by means of a set-screw in the rear of the frog
without removing the clamp and cutter. It is made by Sargent and
Company. The Stanley "Bed Rock" plane has a similar but less
convenient device.</p>

<p>The splitting of the wood in advance of the edge is also prevented
by the breaking of the shaving as it hits against the cutter or
its cap. Hence the advantage of bending up and breaking or partly
breaking the shaving as soon as possible after it is cut. This shows
why the cap is set close to the edge of the cutter. Another reason
is that it thereby stiffens the cutter and
prevents "chattering." If a thick shaving
be desired the cap has to be set farther
back. In a smooth-plane <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">32</span> inch
is enough, in a jack-plane &#8539; inch
is often desirable. The following are
the planes in common use:</p>

<p>The <i>jack-plane</i>, Fig. 102, 14" to 15"
long, is the one used where a considerable
amount of material is to be taken
off to bring a piece of wood to size, and
therefore the outline of the cutting edge
instead of being straight is slightly
curved or "crowned" so that in planing
the surface of a board it makes a series
of shallow grooves, the ridges of which
must afterward be smoothed off by another
plane. Also for beginners whose
hands are not strong it is sometimes wise
to grind the cutter with some "crown",
in order to take off narrow shavings, which require less strength. For
school use, where the jack-plane is used for all purposes, the cutter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[page&nbsp;72]</span>
is usually ground almost straight and only the corners rounded as
in the smooth-plane and the fore-plane.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 5: In whetting a plane-bit, a slight crown may be given it by rubbing
a bit harder at the ends of the edge than in the middle. Strop in the same
way as a chisel (<a class="index" href="#page59">p. 59</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/102-233.png" width="233" height="450" alt="Fig. 102. Sighting Along the Sole of Jack-Plane." /><br /><br />Fig. 102. Sighting Along the Sole of Jack-Plane.</div>

<p>The <i>fore-plane</i>, 22" to 26" long, and the <i>jointer</i>, 28" to 30" long,
are large planes, similar to the jack-plane, except that the cutting edge
is straight. They are used for straightening and smoothing long pieces.</p>

<p>The <i>smooth-plane</i>, 5&frac12;" to 10" long, is a short plane, similar to
the jack-plane, except that the cutting edge is straight. It is used
for smoothing.</p>

<p>These four planes, the jack-plane, the fore-plane, the jointer, and
the smooth-plane, are essentially alike, and directions for the use of
one apply to all.</p>

<p>There are two chief adjustments in the Bailey iron plane: the
brass set-screw, see 8 in Fig. 101, which regulates the depth of the
cut, and the lever, 9, which moves the cutter sidewise so that it may
be made to cut evenly. The skilful worker keeps constant watch of
these adjustments. It is well to form the habit of always sighting
along the sole before beginning to plane, in order to see that the
cutter projects properly, Fig. 102. It is a common mistake among
beginners to let the cutter project too far.</p>


<p>It is important to know what is the best order of procedure in
planing up a board. There are often reasons for omitting the planing
up of one or more surfaces, but it is wise to form the habit of
following a regular order, and the following is suggested as a good one:</p>

<p>1. Working face. Plane one broad side flat and smooth. Finish
with the plane set to cut line shavings. Test with try-square. Mark
this face with a distinct pencil mark, A, Fig. 103.</p>

<p>2. Working edge. Plane one narrow side straight and square
with the working face. Test with try-square, pressing the block of
the try-square against the working face. Mark the working edge
with two distinct pencil marks, B, Fig. 103.</p>

<p>3. End. First mark the width on the working face with the
marking-gage, C, 1-2, Fig. 103. Chisel off the corner, <i>a</i>, of the
piece outside this gaged line. True and smooth this end with the
plane, making it square with both working face and working edge,
D, 2, 3, 4, Fig. 103.</p>

<p>4. Length. Measure the length from the finished end, D, 2-3-4,
score across the working face, D, 5-6, and working edge, D, 6-7,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[page&nbsp;73]</span>
using a sharp knife point and the try-square. Saw just outside this
line, D, 5-6-7, with the back-saw, cut off the narrow corner, D, <i>b</i>,
beyond the gaged line and plane true, E, Fig. 103.</p>

<p>5. Width. Plane to the center of the gaged line, E, 1-2. Test
this edge from the working face, F, Fig. 103.</p>

<p>6. Thickness. Mark the thickness with the marking-gage all
around the piece, F, 8-9-10. Plane to the center of the gaged line,
G, Fig. 103. Test this face for flatness.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/103-800.png"><img src="images/103-341.png" width="341" height="500" alt="Fig. 103. The Order of Planing a Board." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 103. The Order of Planing a Board.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[page&nbsp;74]</span>

<p>In a word, the order to be followed is graphically represented in
H, Fig. 103. The surfaces are numbered consecutively in the order
in which they are to be planed.</p>

<p>The advantages of this order are these: by planing the working
face first, a broad surface is secured to which the others may be made
true. By planing the ends before the
width is planed, the danger of splitting
off fragments can be avoided by chiseling
the corner of the unfinished edges,
C, <i>a</i>, and D, <i>b</i>, Fig. 103, into a buttress.
By planing the ends and the width before
the thickness is planed, a dressed
face is secured all around for gaging
the thickness. In following this order
all measurements and markings are
made on a dressed face.</p>

<p>If there be any "wind" or twist in
the board, this should be discovered first
of all. This may be done roughly by sighting
across the broad side of the board,
Fig. 104, and more accurately by the use
of "winding sticks," see Fig. 205, <a class="index" href="#page113">p. 113</a>.
Or the surface may be tested with the
plane itself by tilting the plane on its
long corner edge, and resting it on the
board, while the worker looks between the board and the plane toward
the light. It is evident that the plane must be turned in various
directions to test for wind, and that
a board only as long or as wide as
the plane is long can be tested in
this way. The try-square or any
straight edge may be used for the
same purpose, Fig. 105. If there be
any wind in the board, this should
at once be taken out of one face by
planing down the high corners.</p>

</table>
<p>In starting to plane, the worker
should bear down on the knob at the front end of the plane. When
the plane is well on the board, he should bear down equally on both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[page&nbsp;75]</span>
knob and handle, and as the plane begins to pass off the board he
should put all the pressure on the handle end, Fig. 106. By taking
pains thus, a convex surface
will be avoided, the making of
which is a common error of beginners.
On the return stroke,
the plane should be lifted or
tilted so that the cutting edge
will not be dulled by rubbing
on the wood. This is especially
important on rough and dirty
boards, as it saves the cutting edge, and in fine work, as it saves the
work. If the plane tear the wood instead of cutting it smooth, as it
should, it is because the planing is "against the grain". This can
often be avoided by noticing the direction of the grain before beginning
to plane. But even if it be not noted beforehand, a stroke or
two will show the roughness. In such a case, it is necessary simply
to turn the wood around.</p>

<p>The accuracy of the work as it progresses should frequently be
tested, and the eye should constantly be trained so that it can more
and more be depended upon to detect inaccuracy, Fig. 107. As each
surface is trued, it should be carefully smoothed with the cutter set
to cut fine shavings.</p>

<p>In planing a very cross-grained piece of wood, there are several
methods to use for securing a smooth
surface. The frog of the plane should
be moved forward so that the throat in
the front of the cutter is a mere slit.
In the ordinary plane it is necessary to
remove the cutter in order to reset the
frog, but in the Sargent plane and the
Stanley "bed rock" plane, it can be set
by a set-screw at the rear of the frog.
Next, the cap should be set so that the
cutter projects but very little beyond it,
or, in technical language, the cutter
should be set "fine." A sliding cut, see
<a class="index" href="#page53">p. 53</a>, should be taken with the plane, and sometimes it may be necessary
to move the plane nearly at right angles to the general direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[page&nbsp;76]</span>
of the grain. By these means even refractory pieces of wood can be
well smoothed. See also scrapers, <a class="index" href="#page91">p. 91</a>.</p>

<p>The choking of a plane is the stoppage of the throat by shavings.
It may be due simply to the fact that the cutter is dull or that it
projects too far below the sole of the plane. In a wooden plane choking
is sometimes due to the crowding of shavings under some part of
the wedge. When the adjustable frog in a modern plane is improperly
placed choking may result. The frog should be far enough forward
so that the cutter rests squarely upon it.</p>

<p>Choking may, and most commonly does, take place because the
cap does not fit down tight on the cutter. This happens if the cap
be nicked or uneven. In consequence, minute shavings are driven
between these two irons and choking soon results. The remedy is to
sharpen the cap, so that its edge makes a close fit with the cutter.
The fit may be made still tighter by rubbing with a screwdriver the
edge of the cap down on the cutter after it is screwed in place.</p>

<p>In no tool is it more important to keep the cutter sharp than in
the plane. To remove the cutter, in order to sharpen it, first loosen
the clamp lever and remove the clamp. Carefully remove the cap
and cutter taking pains not to let the edge hit any part of the plane,
then using the clamp as a screwdriver, loosen the cap-screw and slide
the cap back along the slot in the cutter, where it can be held fast
by a turn of the cap-screw. The edge is now free and can readily be
whetted. When the cap needs to be entirely removed, for instance,
for grinding, after it has been slid along the cutter slot, as before, it
is turned at right angles to the cutter, and then slid down the slot
until the cap-screw unbuttons from the cutter. The object in sliding
the cap up the slot before turning it, is to prevent the danger of injuring
the edge. Some caps are now made with the buttonhole at
the upper end of the slot.</p>

<p>After sharpening, (see under sharpening, <a class="index" href="#page117">p. 117</a>.) the order is reversed
for replacing the cutter. The cap is set at right angles to the
cutter, the cap-screw dropped into the slot, the cap is slid up the
slot, and turned into line with the cutter, and then slid down the slot
till the edge of the cap comes quite near the edge of the cutter. Then
the two are held firmly together with the left hand until the cap
screw is turned tight.</p>

<p>In replacing the cutter and cap in the plane, care should be taken
not to injure the edge and to see that the Y adjustment lever fits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[page&nbsp;77]</span>
into the little slot in the cap; then finally the lever is thrown down
tight. Then, by turning the plane sole upward and glancing down
it, the proper adjustments with the brass set-screw and lateral adjustment
lever are made. When the plane is not being used, it should
rest either on a pillow (a little strip of wood in the bench trough),
or on its side. In no case should it be dropped sole down flat on
the bench.</p>

<p>The <i>block-plane</i>,
Fig. 108,
gets its name
from the fact
that it was first
made for planing
off the ends
of clap-boards,
a process called
"blocking in".</p>

<p>The block-plane was devised for use with one hand, as when it is
used by carpenters in planing pieces not readily taken to a vise or in
planing with a bench-hook. Hence it is made small, 3&frac12;" to 8" long,
the clamp is rounded so as to act as a handle, and the cutter is lowered
to an angle of about 20&deg; to make the plane easy to grasp. The
lower angle of the cutter makes it necessary that the bevel be on the
upper side. Otherwise, to give clearance, the bevel would have to be
made so long and so thin as to be weak. By putting the bevel up,
the angle between the wood and the cutter is maintained practically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[page&nbsp;78]</span>
as in the smooth-plane. Since the block-plane is intended chiefly for
use on end grain, no cap is needed to break the shavings. The adjustable
throat makes it possible to cut a very fine shaving. To facilitate
the cutting action, several forms of block-planes with a very low
angle are now made.</p>

<p>Where both hands are free to hold the plane, the block-plane has
no advantage over a smooth-plane, even on end grain. Moreover, the
cutter cannot be held so firmly in place as that of a smooth-plane, so
that it requires constant adjustment. Hence it is not an easy tool
for amateurs to handle. There is considerable lost motion in the
adjusting nut, and the set-screw, which acts as a knob, is likely to
work loose and be lost. It is hardly to be recommended as a part of
the equipment of the individual bench in school shops.</p>

<p>The piece to be planed with the block-plane may be held either
in the vise, end up, or on a bench-hook, Fig. 109. In end planing
in the vise, in order to avoid
splintering the precaution should
be taken to trim off a corner on
the undressed edge, as directed
on page <a class="index"  href="#page73">73</a>, or else the planing
must be done from both edges
toward the center. The sliding
cut is much easier than the
straight cut, and hence there is
a constant temptation to turn
the plane at an angle perhaps at an expense of the flat surface desired.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/109-500.png" width="500" height="243" alt="Fig. 109. Using the Block-Plane and Bench-Hook." /><br /><br />Fig. 109, Using the Block-Plane and Bench-Hook.</div>

<p>In using the bench-hook the piece to be block-planed is placed
with the working edge against the block, with the end to be planed
to the right and flush with the edge of the bench-hook, in which position
it is held with the left hand. The block-plane, held in the right
hand, is placed on its side on the bench facing toward the work. In
planing, the left hand holds the work firmly against the block of the
bench-hook, pressing it somewhat to the right against the plane. The
right hand holds the side of the plane flat on the bench and presses it
to the left against the bench-hook and work. Held in this position
the plane is pushed forward and back until the end is smoothed.
Considerable practice is necessary to handle the block-plane well.</p>

<p>The <i>scrub-plane</i> is a short plane in which the crown of the cutter,
Fig. 110, is quite curved. It is used to reduce surfaces rapidly.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[page&nbsp;79]</span>

<p>The <i>scratch-plane</i>, Fig. 111, has a toothed cutter which scratches
fine lines along its course. It is used to roughen surfaces of hard
wood which are to be glued together, for otherwise the glue would
not adhere well. Some tropical woods are so hard that their surfaces
can be reduced only by a scratch-plane. It is also useful in preparing
the surface of a very cross-grained piece of wood which cannot be
planed without chipping. By first scratching it carefully in all directions,
it can then be scraped smooth. It is also called a <i>scraper-plane</i>,
because accompanying the plane is a scraper which can be inserted
in the same stock and inclined at any required angle. This
plane-stock prevents the scraper from unduly lowering some portions
of the surface. See also veneer-scraper, <a class="index" href="#page92">p. 92</a>.</p>

Cutter of Scrub-Plane. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 111. Scratch-Plane and Scraper-Plane.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/112-113-600.png" width="600" height="195" alt="Fig. 112. Rabbet-Plane. Fig. 113. Molding-Plane." /><br /><br />Fig. 112. Rabbet-Plane. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 113. Molding-Plane.</div>

<p>The <i>rabbeting-</i> or <i>rebating-plane</i>, Fig. 112, is designed for use in
cutting out a rectangular recess, such as the rabbet on the back of
the picture-frames. In line with the right hand corner of the cutter
is a removable spur to score the wood so that the shaving which follows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[page&nbsp;80]</span>
may be cut out clean and not torn out. With the addition of a
guiding fence it is called a <i>filletster</i>. This may be used on either
the right or left side. In the form shown in
Fig. 112, there is also a depth gage.</p>

<p>In using this plane see that the corner of
the cutter is in line with the sole, and that
both it and the spur are sharp. Set the fence
and the stop at the desired width and depth of
the rabbet. At the first stroke the spur will
score the width. This and every stroke should
be taken as evenly and carefully as if it were
the only one. In the effort to keep the fence
pressed close to the side of the wood, the tendency is to tilt the plane
over. This causes the very opposite effect from that desired, for the
spur runs off diagonally, as
in Fig. 114.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/114-300.png" width="300" height="302" alt="Fig. 114. Result of Careless use of Rabbet-Plane." /><br /><br />Fig. 114. Result of Careless use of Rabbet-Plane.</div>

<p>If this happens stop
planing at once, clean out
the recess properly with a
chisel and then proceed.</p>

<p>The <i>dado-plane</i> is much
like the rabbeting-plane, except
that it is provided with
two spurs, one at each side
of the cutting edge, to score
the wood before cutting.</p>

<p>The <i>molding-plane</i>, Fig. 113, as it name indicates, is for making
moldings of various forms; as, quarter-round, half-round, ogee, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/115-500.png" width="500" height="363" alt="Fig. 115. Tonguing-and-Grooving Plane." /><br /><br />Fig. 115. Tonguing-and-Grooving Plane.</div>

<p>The <i>tonguing-and-grooving-plane</i>,
Fig. 115, is for matching
boards, i.&nbsp;e. making a tongue
in one to fit into a groove in another.
See Fig. 269, No. <a class="index1" href="#d72">72</a>, <a class="index" href="#page182">p. 182</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>circular-plane</i>, Fig. 116.
has a flexible steel face which
can be adjusted to any required
arc, convex or concave, so that
curved surfaces may be planed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/116-400.png" width="400" height="297" alt="Fig. 116. Circular-Plane." /><br /><br />Fig. 116. Circular-Plane.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[page&nbsp;81]</span>

<p>The <i>universal plane</i>, Fig. 117, is a combination of various molding-,
rabbeting-, matching- and other planes. It is capable of many
adjustments and applications. The principal parts of this plane are:
a <i>main stock</i>, <i>A</i>, with two sets of transverse sliding arms, a
<i>depth-gage</i>,
<i>F</i>, adjusted by a screw, and a <i>slitting cutter</i> with stop, a
<i>sliding
section</i>, <i>B</i>, with a vertically adjustable bottom, the <i>auxiliary
center
bottom</i>, <i>C</i>, to be placed when needed in front of the cutter as an
extra
support or stop. This bottom is adjustable both vertically and laterally.
<i>Fences</i>, <i>D and E</i>. For fine work, fence <i>D</i> has a lateral
adjustment
by means of a thumb-screw. The fences can be used on
either side of the plane, and the rosewood guides can be tilted to any
desired angle up to 45&deg;, by loosening the screws on the face. Fence
<i>E</i> can be reversed for center-beading wide boards. For work thinner
than the depth of the fence, the work may overhang the edge of the
bench and fence <i>E</i> be removed. An <i>adjustable stop</i>, to be used in
beading the edges of matched boards, is inserted on the left side of
the sliding section <i>B</i>. A great variety of cutters are supplied, such
as: molding, matching, sash, beading, reeding, fluting, hollow,
round, plow, rabbet, and filletster. Special shapes can be obtained
by order.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/117-600.png" width="600" height="293" alt="Fig. 117. Universal Plane." /><br /><br />Fig. 117. Universal Plane.</div>

<p><i>The Use of the Universal Plane.</i> Insert the proper cutter, adjusting
it so that the portion of it in line with the main stock, <i>A</i>, will
project below the sole the proper distance for cutting.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[page&nbsp;82]</span>

<p>Adjust the bottom of the sliding section, <i>B</i>, so that the lowest
portion of the cutter will project the proper distance below it for cutting.
Tighten the check nuts on the transverse arms and <i>then</i>
tighten the thumb-screws which secure the sliding section to the arms.
The sliding section is not always necessary, as in a narrow rabbet
or bead.</p>

<p>When an additional support is needed for the cutter, the auxiliary
center bottom, <i>C</i>, may
be adjusted in front
of it. This may also
be used as a stop.</p>

<p>Adjust one or both
of the fences, <i>D</i> and
<i>E</i>, and fasten with the thumb-screws. Adjust the depth-gage, <i>F</i>, at
the proper depth.</p>

<p>For a <i>dado</i> remove the fences and set the spurs parallel with the
edges of the cutter. Insert the long adjustable stop on the left hand
of the sliding section. For slitting, insert the cutter and stop on the
right side of the main stock and use either fence for a guide.</p>

<p>For a <i>chamfer</i>, insert the desired cutter, and tilt the rosewood
guides on the fences to the required angle. For <i>chamfer beading</i> use
in the same manner, and gradually feed the cutter down by means
of the adjusting thumb-nut.</p>

<p>There are also a number of
planelike tools such as the following:</p>

<p>The <i>spoke-shave</i>, Fig. 118.
works on the same principle as a
plane, except that the guiding surface
is very short. This adapts it
to work with curved outlines. It
is a sort of regulated draw-shave.
It is sometimes made of iron with
an adjustable mouth, which is a
convenient form for beginners to
use, and is easy to sharpen. The
<i>pattern-makers spokeshave</i>, Fig.
119, which has a wooden frame, is better suited to more careful work.
The method of using the spokeshave is shown in Fig. 120.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/118-119-600.png" width="600" height="91" alt="Fig. 118. Iron Spokeshave. Fig. 119. Pattern-maker's Spokeshave." /><br /><br />Fig. 118.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[page&nbsp;83]</span>

<p>The <i>router-plane</i>, Figs. 121 and 122, is used to lower a certain
part of a surface and yet keep it parallel with the surrounding part,
and it is particularly useful in cutting
panels, dadoes, and grooves. The cutter
has to be adjusted for each successive
cut. Where there are a number of
dadoes to be cut of the same depth, it
is wise not to finish them one at a
time, but to carry on the cutting of all
together, lowering the cutter after each
round. In this way all the dadoes will
be finished at exactly the same depth.</p>

<p>The <i>dowel-pointer</i>, Fig. 123, is a convenient tool for removing the
sharp edges from the ends of dowel pins. It is held in a brace. The
cutter is adjustable
and is removable for
sharpening.</p>

<p>The <i>cornering tool</i>,
Fig. 124, is a simple
device for rounding
sharp corners. A cutter
at each end cuts
both ways so that it
can be used with the
grain without changing
the position of the work. The depth of the cut is fixed.</p>

<h4>2. BORING TOOLS.</h4>

<p>Some boring tools, like awls, force the material apart, and some,
like augers, remove material.</p>

<p>The <i>brad-awl</i>, Fig. 125, is wedge-shaped, and hence care needs to
be taken in using it to keep the edge
across the grain so as to avoid splitting
the wood, especially thin wood. The
size is indicated by the length of the
blade when new,&mdash;a stupid method. The
awl is useful for making small holes in
soft wood, and it can readily be sharpened by grinding.</p>

<p><i>Gimlets</i> and <i>drills</i> are alike in that they cut away material, but
unlike in that the cutting edge of the gimlet is on the side, while
the cutting edge of the drill is on the end.</p>

<p><i>Twist-drills</i>, Fig. 126, are very hard and may be used in drilling
metal. They are therefore useful where there is danger of meeting
nails, as in repair work. Their sizes are indicated by a special drill
gage, Fig. 220, <a class="index" href="#page116">p. 116</a>.</p>

<p><i>Twist-bits</i>, Fig. 127, are like twist-drills except that they are not
hard enough to use for metal. Their sizes are indicated on the tang
in 32nds of an inch. Both twist-bits and drill-bits have the advantage
over gimlet-bits in that they are less likely to split the wood.</p>

<p>Twist-bits and twist-drills are sharpened on a grindstone, care
being taken to preserve the original angle of the cutting edge so that
the edge will meet the wood and there will be clearance.</p>

<p><i>German gimlet-bits</i>, Fig. 128, have the advantage of centering
well. The size is indicated on the tang in 32nds of an inch. They
are useful in boring holes for short blunt screws as well as deep holes.
They cannot be sharpened readily but are cheap and easily replaced.</p>

<p><i>Bit-point drills</i>, Fig. 129, are useful for accurate work, but are
expensive.</p>

<p><i>Auger-bits</i>, Fig. 130, have several important features. The spur
centers the bit in its motion, and since it is in the form of a pointed
screw draws the auger into the wood. Two sharp nibs on either side
score the circle, out of which the lips cut the shavings, which are
then carried out of the hole by the main screw of the tool. The size
of auger-bits is indicated by a figure on the tang in 16ths of an inch.
Thus 9 means a diameter of <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>9</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span>".</p>

<p>There are three chief precautions to be taken in using auger-bits.
(1) One is to bore perpendicularly to the surface. A good way to
do this is to lay the work flat, either on the bench or in the vise, and
sight first from the front and then from the side of the work, to see
that the bit is perpendicular both ways. The test may also be made
with the try-square, Fig. 137, or with a plumb-line, either by the
worker, or in difficult pieces, by a fellow worker. The sense of
perpendicularity,
however, should constantly be cultivated. (2) Another
precaution is that, in thru boring, the holes should not be bored quite
thru from one side, lest the wood be splintered off on the back. When
the spur pricks thru, the bit should be removed, the piece turned over,
and the boring finished, putting the spur in the hole which is pricked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[page&nbsp;86]</span>
thru in boring from the first side. It is seldom necessary to press
against the knob of the brace in boring, as the thread on the spur
will pull the bit thru, especially in soft wood. Indeed, as the bit
reaches nearly thru the board, if the knob is gently pulled back, then
when the spur pricks thru the bit will
be pulled out of its hole. This avoids
the necessity of constantly watching the
back of the board to see if the spur is
thru. (3) In stop boring, as in boring
for dowels or in making a blind mortise,
care should be taken not to bore thru
the piece. For this purpose an auger-bit-gage,
Fig. 219, <a class="index" href="#page116">p. 116</a>, may be used,
or a block of wood of the proper length
thru which a hole has been bored, may
be slipped over the bit, or the length of
bit may be noted before boring, and
then the length of the projecting portion
deducted, or the number of turns
needed to reach the required depth may
be counted on a trial piece. Tying a
string around a bit, or making a chalk
mark on it is folly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/137-262.png" width="262" height="450" alt="Fig. 137. Using a Try-Square as a Guide in Boring." /><br /><br />Fig. 137. Using a Try-Square as a Guide in Boring.</div>

<p>Auger-bits are sharpened with an auger-bit file, Fig. 142, <a class="index" href="#page90">p. 90</a>,
a small flat file with two narrow safe edges at one end and two wide
safe edges at the other. The "nibs" should be filed on the inside so
that the diameter of the cut may remain as large as that of the body
of the bit. The cutting lip should be sharpened from the side toward
the spur, care being taken to preserve the original angle so as to give
clearance. If sharpened from the upper side, that is, the side toward
the shank, the nibs will tend to become shorter.</p>

<p>The <i>plug-cutter</i>, Fig. 131, is useful for cutting plugs with which
to cover the heads of screws that are deeply countersunk.</p>

<p><i>Center-bits</i>, Fig. 132, work on the same principle as auger-bits,
except that the spurs have no screw, and hence have to be pushed
forcibly into the wood. Sizes are given in 16ths of an inch. They
are useful for soft wood, and in boring large holes in thin material
which is likely to split. They are sharpened in the same way as
auger-bits.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[page&nbsp;87]</span>

<p><i>Foerstner bits</i>, Fig. 133, are peculiar in having no spur, but are
centered by a sharp edge around the circumference. The size is indicated
on the tang, in 16ths of an inch. They are useful in boring
into end grain, and in boring part way into wood so thin that a spur
would pierce thru. They can be sharpened only with special appliances.</p>

<p><i>Expansive-bits</i>, Fig. 134, are so made as to bore holes of different
sizes by adjusting the movable nib and cutter. There are two sizes,
the small one with two cutters, boring from &frac12;" to 1&frac12;" and the
large one with three cutters boring from &#8542;" to 4". They are very
useful on particular occasions,
but have to be used with care.</p>

<p><i>Reamers</i>, Fig. 135, are used
for enlarging holes already
made. They are made square,
half-round and six cornered in
shape.</p>

<p><i>Countersinks</i>, Fig. 136, are
reamers in the shape of a flat
cone, and are used to make holes for the heads of screws. The rose
countersink is the most satisfactory form.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/138-400.png" width="400" height="190" alt="Fig. 138. Washer-Cutter." /><br /><br />Fig 138. Washer-Cutter.</div>

<p>The <i>washer-cutter</i>, Fig. 138, is useful not only for cutting out
washers but also for cutting holes in thin wood. The size is adjustable.</p>


<h4>3. CHOPPING TOOLS.</h4>

<p>The primitive celt, which was hardly more than a wedge, has been
differentiated into three modern hand tools, the <i>chisel</i>, see above, <a class="index" href="#page53">p. 53</a>, the <i>ax</i>, Fig. 139, and the <i>adze</i>, Fig. 141.</p>

<p>The <i>ax</i> has also been differentiated into the <i>hatchet</i>, with a short
handle, for use with one hand, while the ax-handle is long, for use
with two hands. Its shape is an adaption to its manner of use. It
is oval in order to be strongest in the direction of the blow and also
in order that the axman may feel and guide the direction of the
blade. The curve at the end is to avoid the awkward raising of the
left hand at the moment of striking the blow, and the knob keeps it
from slipping thru the hand. In both ax and hatchet there is a two-beveled
edge. This is for the sake of facility in cutting into the wood
at any angle.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[page&nbsp;88]</span>

<p>There are two principal forms, the common ax and the two bitted
ax, the latter used chiefly in lumbering. There is also a wedge-shaped
ax for splitting wood. As among all tools, there is among
axes a great variety for special uses.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/139-141-600.png" width="600" height="166" alt="Fig. 139. Ax. Fig. 140. Shingling Hatchet. Fig. 141, Carpenter's Adze." /><br />

<p>The <i>hatchet</i> has, beside the cutting edge, a head for driving nails,
and a notch for drawing them, thus combining three tools in one.
The shingling hatchet, Fig. 140, is a type of this.</p>

<p>The <i>adze</i>, the carpenter's house adze, Fig. 141, is flat on the lower
side, since its use is for straightening surfaces.</p>

<h4>4. SCRAPING TOOLS.</h4>

<p>Scraping tools are of such nature that they can only abrade or
smooth surfaces.</p>

<p><i>Files</i>. Figs. 142-146, are formed with a series of cutting edges or
teeth. These teeth are cut when the metal is soft and cold and then the
tool is hardened. There are in use at least three thousand varieties of
files, each of which is adapted to its particular purpose. Lengths are
measured from point to heel exclusive of the tang. They are classified:
(1) according to their outlines into blunt, (i.&nbsp;e., having a uniform
cross section thruout), and taper; (2) according to the shape of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[page&nbsp;91]</span>
cross-section, into flat, square, three-square or triangular, knife, round
or rat-tail, half-round, etc.; (3) according to the manner of their
serrations, into single cut or "float" (having single, unbroken, parallel,
chisel cuts across the surface), double-cut, (having two sets of
chisel cuts crossing each other obliquely,) open cut, (having series of
parallel cuts, slightly staggered,) and
safe edge, (or side,) having one or more
uncut surfaces; and (4) according to
the fineness of the cut, as rough, bastard,
second cut, smooth, and dead
smooth. The "mill file," a very common
form, is a flat, tapered, single-cut file.</p>

<p><i>Rasps</i>, Fig. 147, differ from files in that instead of having cutting
teeth made by lines, coarse projections are made by making indentations
with a triangular point when the iron is soft. The difference
between files and rasps is clearly shown in Fig. 149.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/149-300.png" width="300" height="87" alt="Fig. 149. a. Diagram of a Rasp Tooth. b. Cross-Section of a Single-Cut File." /><br /><br />Fig. 149. a. Diagram of a Rasp Tooth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Cross-Section of a Single-Cut File.</div>

<p>It is a good rule that files and rasps are to be used on wood only
as a last resort, when no cutting tool will serve. Great care must be
taken to file flat, not letting the tool rock. It is better to file only on
the forward stroke, for that is the way the teeth are made to cut, and
a flatter surface is more likely to be obtained.</p>

<p>Both files and rasps can be cleaned with a
<i>file-card</i>, Fig. 148. They are sometimes sharpened
with a sandblast, but ordinarily when dull
are discarded.</p>

<p><i>Scrapers</i> are thin, flat pieces of steel. They
may be rectangular, or some of the edges may
be curved. For scraping hollow surfaces curved
scrapers of various shapes are necessary. Convenient
shapes are shown in Fig. 150. The cutting
power of scrapers depends upon the delicate burr or feather along
their edges. When properly sharpened they take off not dust but fine
shavings. Scrapers are particularly useful in smoothing cross-grained
pieces of wood, and in cleaning off glue, old varnish, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/150-200.png" width="200" height="201" alt="Fig. 150. Molding-Scrapers." /><br /><br />Fig. 150. Molding-Scrapers.</div>

<p>There are various devices for holding scrapers in frames or handles,
such as the scraper-plane, Fig. 111, <a class="index" href="#page79">p. 79</a>, the veneer-scraper,
and box-scrapers. The <i>veneer-scraper</i>, Fig. 151, has the advantage
that the blade may be sprung to a slight curve by a thumb-screw in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[page&nbsp;92]</span>
the middle of the back, just as an ordinary scraper is when held in
the hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/151-400.png" width="400" height="241" alt="Fig. 151. Using a Veneer-Scraper." /><br /><br />Fig. 151. Using a Veneer-Scraper.</div>

<p>In use, Fig. 152, the scraper may be either pushed or pulled.
When pushed, the scraper is held firmly in both hands, the fingers
on the forward and the thumbs
on the back side. It is tilted
forward, away from the operator,
far enough so that it will
not chatter and is bowed back
slightly, by pressure of the
thumbs, so that there is no
risk of the corners digging in.
When pulled the position is
reversed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/152-400.png" width="400" height="236" alt="Fig. 152. Using a Cabinet-Scraper." /><br /><br />Fig. 152. Using a Cabinet-Scraper.</div>
<br clear="all" />

<p>One method of sharpening
the scraper is as follows: the scraper is first brought to the desired
shape, straight or curved. This may be done either by grinding on
the grindstone or by filing with a smooth, flat file, the scraper, while
held in a vise. The edge is then carefully draw-filed, i.&nbsp;e., the file, a
smooth one, is held (one hand at each end) directly at right angles
to the edge of the scraper, Fig. 153, and moved sidewise from end to
end of the scraper, until the edge is quite square with the sides.
Then the scraper is laid flat on the oilstone and rubbed, first on one
side and then on the other till the sides are bright and smooth along
the edge, Fig. 154. Then it is
set on edge on the stone and
rubbed till there are two sharp
square corners all along the
edge, Fig. 155. Then it is put
in the vise again and by means
of a burnisher, or scraper
steel, both of these corners are
carefully turned or bent over
so as to form a fine burr. This
is done by tipping the scraper
steel at a slight angle with the edge and rubbing it firmly along the
sharp corner, Fig. 156.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/153-400.png" width="400" height="274" alt="Fig. 153. Sharpening a Cabinet-Scraper: 1st Step, Drawfiling." /><br /><br />Fig. 153. Sharpening a Cabinet-Scraper: 1st Step, Drawfiling.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/155-400.png" width="400" height="199" alt="Fig. 155. Sharpening a Cabinet-Scraper: 3rd Step, Removing the Wire-Edge." /><br /><br />Fig. 155. Sharpening a Cabinet-Scraper: 3rd Step, Removing the Wire-Edge.</div>

<p>To resharpen the scraper it is not necessary to file it afresh every
time, but only to flatten out the edges and turn them again with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[page&nbsp;93]</span>
slightly more bevel. Instead of using the oilstone an easier, tho less
perfect, way to flatten out the burr on the edges is to lay the scraper
flat on the bench near the edge. The scraper steel is then passed rapidly
to and fro on the flat side
of the scraper, Fig. 157. After
that the edge should be
turned as before.</p>

<p><i>Sandpaper</i>. The "sand"
is crushed quartz and is very
hard and sharp. Other materials
on paper or cloth are also
used, as carborundum, emery,
and so on. Sandpaper comes
in various grades of coarseness
from No. 00 (the finest)
to No. 3, indicated on the back of each sheet. For ordinary purposes
No. 00 and No. 1 are sufficient. Sandpaper sheets may readily be
torn by placing the sanded side down, one-half of the sheet projecting
over the square edge of the bench. With a quick downward motion
the projecting portion
easily parts. Or it may be torn
straight by laying the sandpaper
on a bench, sand side down,
holding the teeth of a back-saw
along the line to be torn.
In this case, the smooth surface
of the sandpaper would be against the saw.</p>

<p>Sandpaper should never be used to scrape and scrub work into
shape, but only to obtain an extra smoothness. Nor ordinarily should
it be used on a piece of wood until all the work with cutting tools
is done, for the fine particles
of sand remaining in the wood
dull the edge of the tool.
Sometimes in a piece of cross-grained
wood rough places will
be discovered by sandpapering.
The surface should then be
wiped free of sand and scraped
before using a cutting tool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[page&nbsp;94]</span>
again. In order to avoid cross scratches, work should be "sanded"
with the grain, even if this takes much trouble. For flat surfaces,
and to touch off edges, it is best to wrap the sandpaper over a rectangular
block of wood, of which the corners are slightly rounded, or
it may be fitted over special
shapes of wood for specially
shaped surfaces. The objection
to using the thumb or
fingers instead of a block, is
that the soft portions of the
wood are cut down faster than
the hard portions, whereas the
use of a block tends to keep the
surface even.</p>

<p><i>Steel wool</i> is made by turning
off fine shavings from the
edges of a number of thin discs
of steel, held together in a
lathe. There are various grades of coarseness, from No. 00 to No. 3.
Its uses are manifold: as a substitute for sandpaper, especially on
curved surfaces, to clean up paint, and to rub down shellac to an
"egg-shell" finish. Like sandpaper it should not be used till all the
work with cutting tools is done. It can be manipulated until utterly
worn out.</p>


<h4>5. POUNDING TOOLS.</h4>

<p>The <i>hammer</i> consists of two distinct parts, the head and the
handle. The head is made of steel, so hard that it will not be indented
by hitting against nails or the butt of nailsets, punches, etc.,
which are comparatively soft. It can easily be injured tho, by being
driven against steel harder than
itself. The handle is of hickory
and of an oval shape to
prevent its twisting in the hand.</p>

<p>Hammers may be classified
as follows: (1) hammers for
striking blows only; as, the
blacksmith's hammer and the
stone-mason's hammer, and (2)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[page&nbsp;95]</span>
compound hammers, which consist of two tools combined, the face for
striking, and the "peen" which may be a claw, pick, wedge, shovel,
chisel, awl or round head for other uses. There are altogether about
fifty styles of hammers varying in size from a jeweler's hammer to a
blacksmith's great straight-handled sledge-hammer, weighing twenty
pounds or more. They are named mostly according to their uses;
as, the riveting-hammer, Fig. 159, the upholsterer's hammer, Fig.
160, the veneering-hammer, Fig. 162, etc. Magnetized hammers,
Fig. 161, are used in many trades for driving brads and tacks, where
it is hard to hold them in place with the fingers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/158-162-600.png" width="600" height="413" alt="Fig. 158. Claw-Hammer. Fig. 159. Riveting-Hammer. Fig. 160. Upholster's Hammer. Fig. 161. Magnetized Hammer. Fig. 162. Veneering-Hammer." /><br /></div>

<p>In the "bell-faced" hammer, the face is slightly convex, in order
that the last blow in driving nails may set the nail-head below the
surface. It is more difficult to strike a square blow with it than with
a plain-faced hammer. For ordinary woodwork the plain-faced, that
is, flat-faced claw-hammer, Fig. 158, is best. It is commonly used in
carpenter work.</p>

<p>It is essential that the face of the hammer be kept free from glue
in order to avoid its sticking on the nail-head and so bending the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[page&nbsp;96]</span>
nail. Hammers should be used to hit iron only; for hitting wood,
mallets are used. In striking with the hammer, the wrist, the elbow
and the shoulder are one or all brought into play, according to the
hardness of the blow. The essential
precautions are that the handle be
grasped at the end, that the blow be
square and quick, and that the wood
be not injured. At the last blow the
hammer should not follow the nail, but
should be brought back with a quick
rebound. To send the nail below the
surface, a nailset is used. (See below.)</p>

<p>The claw is used for extracting nails.
To protect the wood in withdrawing a
nail a block may be put under the
hammer-head. When a nail is partly
drawn, the leverage can be greatly increased
by continuing to block up in this way, Fig. 163.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/163-300.png" width="300" height="358" alt="Fig. 163. Drawing a Nail with Claw-Hammer." /><br /><br />Fig. 163. Drawing a Nail with Claw-Hammer.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/164-341.png" width="341" height="450" alt="Fig. 164. Mallets." /><br /><br />Fig. 164. Mallets.</div>

<p>The <i>mallet</i>, Fig. 164, differs from the hammer in having a wooden
instead of a steel head. A maul or beetle is a heavy wooden mallet.
The effect of the blow of a mallet is quite different from that of a
hammer, in that the force
is exerted more gradually;
whereas the effect of the hammer
blow is direct, immediate,
and local, and is taken up at
once. But a mallet continues
to act after the first impulse,
pushing, as it were. This is
because of the elasticity of the
head. A chisel, therefore,
should always be driven with
a mallet, for the chisel handle
would soon go to pieces under
the blows of a hammer, because
of their suddenness;
whereas the mallet blow which
is slower will not only drive
the blade deeper with the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[page&nbsp;97]</span>
force, but will not injure the handle so rapidly. Mallet-heads are
made square, cylindrical, and barrel-shaped. Carver's mallets are
often turned from one piece, hammer and head on one axis.</p>

<p><i>Nailsets</i>, Fig. 165, are made with hardened points, but softer
butts, so that the hammer will not be injured. They were formerly
made square when nail heads
were square, but now round
ones are common. To obviate
slipping, some have "cup
points," that is, with a concave
tip, and some spur points.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/165-400.png" width="400" height="303" alt="Fig. 165. Using a Nailset." /><br /><br />Fig. 165. Using a Nailset.</div>

<p>To keep the nailset in its
place on the nail-head it may
be held closely against the
third finger of the left hand,
which rests on the wood close
to the nail. When a nailset
is lacking, the head of a brad,
held nearly flat, may be used. But care is necessary to avoid bruising
the wood.</p>


<h4>6. HOLDING TOOLS.</h4>

<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">A. <i>Tools for Holding Work</i>.</h4>

<p>The advance in ease of handworking may largely be measured by
the facilities for holding materials or other tools. The primitive
man used no devices for holding except his hands and feet. The
Japanese, who perhaps are the most skilful of joiners, still largely
use their fingers and toes. On the other hand, Anglo-Saxons have
developed an enormous variety of methods for holding work and tools.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[page&nbsp;98]</span>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/166-600.png" width="600" height="492" alt="Fig. 166. Bench made with Pinned Mortise-and-Tenon Joints, Low Back." /><br /><br />Fig. 166. Bench made with Pinned Mortise-and-Tenon Joints, Low Back.</div>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/167-600.png" width="600" height="385" alt="Fig. 167. Woodworking Bench used at Pratt Institute, Showing Self-Adjusting Upright Vise." /><br /><br />Fig. 167. Woodworking Bench used at Pratt Institute, Showing Self-Adjusting Upright Vise.</div>


<p><i>Benches</i>. The essential features of a work-bench are a firm, steady
table with a vise and places for tools. The joints are either pinned
or wedged mortise-and-tenon, or draw-bolt joints. The best benches
are made of maple, the tops being strips joined or tongued-and-grooved
together. It is common also to have a trough at the back
of the top of the bench, i.&nbsp;e., a space 6" or 8" wide, set lower than
the upper surface, in which tools may be placed so as not to roll off.
A low pillow, fastened at the left hand end of the trough, on which
to set planes in order that the edge of the cutter may not be injured,
is an advantage. The tool-rack is of capital importance. It has

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[page&nbsp;99]</span>
been common in school benches to affix it to a board, which rises considerably
above the top of the bench, Fig. 169, but a better plan
is to have the top of it no higher than the bench-top, Fig. 166.
Then the light on the bench
is not obscured, and when a
flat top is needed for large
work it can readily be had by
removing the tools. Elaborate
benches with lock drawers
are also much used in the
shops of large city schools.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/168-400.png" width="400" height="307" alt="Fig. 168. A Rapid-Acting Vise." /><br /><br />Fig. 168. A Rapid-Acting Vise.</div>

<p><i>Vises</i> for holding wood are
of three general styles, (1)
those with an upright wooden
jaw, Fig. 167, which holds wide pieces of work well. They are now
made with an automatic adjusting device by which the jaw and the
face of the bench are kept parallel; (2) wooden vises with a horizontal
jaw, guided by parallel runners, Fig. 166, and, (3) metal
rapid-acting vises, Fig. 168. The latter are the most durable and in
most respects more convenient. Special vises are also made for wood-carvers,
for saw-filing, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/169-600.png" width="600" height="394" alt="Fig. 169. Holding a Large Board in Vise for Planing." /><br /><br />Fig. 169. Holding a Large Board in Vise for Planing.</div>

<p>The best woodworking benches are equipped with both side- and
tail-vises. The tail-vise is supplemented by movable bench-stops for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[page&nbsp;100]</span>
holding pieces of different lengths. In planing the side of a board
it is held in place between the tail-vise and one of the bench-stops. A
board should not be squeezed sidewise between the jaws of a vise
when it is to be planed, lest it
be bent out of shape. In planing
the edge of a board it is
ordinarily held in the side-vise.
A long board, one end
of which is in the vise, may
also need to be supported at
the other end. This may be
done by clamping to it a handscrew,
the jaw of which rests
on the top of the bench, Fig.
169. When the vise is likely
to be twisted out of square by
the insertion of a piece of wood
at one end of it, it is well to
insert another piece of equal thickness at the other end of the vise
to keep it square, as in Fig. 120, <a href="#page82" style="font-weight: normal;">p. 82</a>. In this case, (Fig. 120,) the
extra piece also supports the piece being worked upon.</p>

<p>The vise is also of great use in carrying on many other processes,
but a good workman does not
use it to the exclusion of the
saw-horse and bench-hook.</p>

<p>Horses are of great use
both for the rough sawing of
material and in supporting
large pieces during the process
of construction. The common
form is shown in Fig. 170,
but a more convenient form
for sawing has an open top, as
in Fig. 171.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/170-400.png" width="400" height="367" alt="Fig. 170. Saw-Horse." /><br /><br />Fig. 170. Saw-Horse.</div>

<p>The <i>picture-frame-vise</i>, Fig.
172, is a very convenient tool
for making mitered joints, as in picture-frames. The vise holds two
sides firmly so that after gluing they may be either nailed together
or a spline inserted in a saw cut previously made. See Fig. 268,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[page&nbsp;101]</span>
No. <a class="index1" href="#d55">55</a>, <a class="index" href="#page181">p. 181</a>. If the last joint in a picture-frame does not quite
match, a kerf may be sawn at the junction of the two pieces, which
can then be drawn close together.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/172-400.png" width="400" height="342" alt="Fig. 172. Picture-Frame-Vise." /><br /><br />Fig. 172. Picture-Frame-Vise.</div>

<p><i>Handscrews</i>, Fig. 173, consist of four parts, the shoulder jaw and
the screw jaw, made of maple,
and the end spindle and the
middle spindle, made of hickory.
The parts when broken
can be bought separately.
Handscrews vary in size from
those with jaws four inches
long to those with jaws twenty-two
inches long. The best kind
are oiled so that glue will not
adhere to them. In adjusting
the jaws, if the handle of the
middle spindle is held in one
hand, and the handle of the
end spindle in the other hand, and both are revolved together, the
jaws may be closed or opened evenly, Fig. 174. In use care must be
taken to keep the jaws parallel, in order to obtain the greatest pressure
and to prevent the spindles from being broken. It is always
important to have the jaws press on the work evenly. To secure this,
the middle spindle should be
tightened first, and then the
end spindle. Handscrews are
convenient for a great variety
of uses, as clamping up glued
pieces, holding pieces together
temporarily for boring, Fig.
247, <a class="index" href="#page152">p. 152</a>, holding work at
any desired angle in the vise,
as for chamfering or beveling,
Fig. 175, etc.</p>

<p><i>Clamps</i> are made of both
wood and iron, the most satisfactory
for speed, strength, and durability are steel-bar carpenter
clamps, Fig. 176. They vary in length from 1&frac12; ft. to 8 ft. The
separate parts are the steel bar A, the cast-iron frame B, the tip C
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[page&nbsp;102]</span>
into which fits the screw D, on the other end of which is the crank E,
and the slide F with its dog G, which engages in the notches on the
bar. Any part, if broken, can
be replaced separately.</p>

<p><i>Iron Handscrews</i>, also
called C clamps and carriage-makers'
clamps. Fig. 177, are
useful in certain kinds of work,
as in gluing in special places
and in wood-carving. All iron
clamps need blocks of soft
wood to be placed between them
and the finished work.</p>

<p><i>Pinch-dogs</i>, Fig. 178, are a
convenient device for drawing
together two pieces of wood,
when injury to the surfaces in
which they are driven does not matter. They vary in size from &frac34;"
to 2&frac34;". For ordinary purposes the smallest size is sufficient. For
especially fine work,
double-pointed tacks,
properly filed, are convenient.</p>

<p>The <i>bench-hook</i>,
Fig. 179, is a simple
device for holding
firmly small pieces of
work when they are
being sawn, chisled,
etc. It also saves the
bench from being
marred. The angles
should be kept exactly
square.</p>

<p>The <i>miter-box</i>, Fig.

with the addition of
a guide for the saw. The
<i>iron miter-box</i>, Fig. 181,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[page&nbsp;103]</span>
with the saw adjustable to various angles, insures accurate work.</p>

<p>Such tools as <i>pliers</i>, Fig. 182, <i>pincers</i>, Fig. 183, and
<i>nippers</i>,
Fig. 184, made for gripping iron, are often useful in the woodworking
shop. So are various sorts of <i>wrenches</i>; as fixed, socketed, adjustable,
monkey- and pipe-wrenches.</p>

<h4>B. <i>Tools for holding other tools</i>.</h4>

<p>The <i>brace</i> or <i>bit-stock</i>, Fig. 185, holds all sorts of boring tools
as well as screwdrivers, dowel-pointers, etc. The simple brace or
bit-stock consists of a chuck, a
handle, and a knob, and is sufficient
for ordinary use; but
the ratchet-brace enables the
user to bore near to surfaces
or corners where a complete
sweep cannot be made. It is
also useful where sufficient
power can be applied only at
one part of the sweep. By
means of pawls which engage
in the ratchet-wheel, the bit
can be turned in either direction
at the will of the user. The size of the
brace is indicated by the "sweep," that is, the
diameter of the circle thru which the swinging
handle turns. To insert a bit or other tool,
Fig. 186, grasp firmly with one hand the sleeve
of the chuck pointing it upward, and revolve
the handle with the other hand, unscrewing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[page&nbsp;104]</span>
sleeve until the jaws open enough to admit the whole tang of the bit.
Then reverse the motion and the bit will be held tightly in place.
Various hand-, breast-, bench-, bow-drills and automatic drills are of
use in doing quick work and for boring small holes, Fig. 187.</p>

<p>The <i>screwdriver</i>, Fig. 188, is a sort
of holding tool for turning, and so driving
screws. Various devices have been
tried to prevent the twisting in the
handle. This is now practically assured
in various makes. The other important
matter in a screwdriver is that the
point be of the right temper, so as
neither to bend nor to break. If the corners break they can be reground,
but care should be taken not to make the angle too obtuse
or the driver will slip out of the slot in the screw-head. The bevel
should have a long taper. A
shop should be equipped with
different sizes of screwdrivers
to fit the different sizes of
screws. Screwdrivers vary in
size, the shank ranging in
length from 2&frac12;" to 18". A
long screwdriver is more powerful
than a short one, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[page&nbsp;105]</span>
screwdriver is rarely exactly in line with the axis of the screw, but
the handle revolves in a circle. This means an increased leverage, so
that the longer the screwdriver,
the greater the leverage.</p>

<h4>7. MEASURING AND MARKING TOOLS.</h4>

<p>It is a long step from the time when one inch meant the width
of the thumb, and one foot meant the length of the foot, to the measuring
of distances and of angles which
vary almost infinitesimally. No such
accuracy is necessary in measuring wood
as in measuring metal, but still there
is a considerable variety of tools for
this purpose.</p>


<!--<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[page&nbsp;106]</span>-->


<p>For measuring distances, the <i>rule</i>,
Fig. 191, is the one in most common
use. It is usually made of boxwood.
For convenience it is hinged so as to
fold. A rule is called "two-fold" when
it is made of two pieces, "four-fold"
when made of four pieces, etc. When
measuring or marking from it, it can
be used more accurately by turning it
on edge, so that the lines of the graduations
may come directly against the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[page&nbsp;107]</span>
work. The one in most common
use in school shops, is a
two-foot, two-fold rule. Some
instructors prefer to have pupils
use a four-fold rule, because
that is the form commonly
used in the woodworking
trades. Steel bench-rules,
Fig. 192, are satisfactory in
school work because unbreakable and because they do
not disappear so rapidly as pocket rules. They need
to be burnished occasionally.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/191-600.png" width="600" height="70" alt="Fig. 191. Two-Foot Rule. Two Fold." /><br /><br />Fig. 191. Two-Foot Rule. Two Fold.</div>

<p>The <i>steel square</i>, Figs. 193, 194, 196, 197, is
useful, not only as a straight-edge and try-square,
but also for a number of graduations and tables
which are stamped on it. There are various forms,
but the one in most common use consists of a blade
or "body" 24"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;2" and a "tongue," 16"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;1&frac12;", at right
angles to each other. Sargent's trade number for this
form is 100. It includes graduations in hundredths,
thirty-seconds, sixteenths, twelfths, tenths, and eighths
of an inch, also a brace-measure, an eight-square
measure, and the Essex board-measure. Another style,
instead of an Essex board-measure, and the hundredths
graduation has a rafter-table. The side upon
which the name of the maker is stamped, is called
the "face," and the reverse side the "back."</p>

<p>The brace-measure is to be found along the center
of the back of the tongue, Fig. 193. It is used thus:
the two equal numbers set one above the other represent
the sides of a square, and the single number
to their right, represents in inches and decimals, the
diagonal of that square.</p>
<table align="center" summary="squares" border="0" style="margin-top:-1em;">
<tr>
       <td class="main" rowspan="2" valign="middle">E. g.,</td>
	   <td class="small">54</td>
	   <td class="main" rowspan="2" valign="middle">76.37 &nbsp;&nbsp;means that
a square the sides of which are 54" would have a
diagonal of 76.37".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
       <td class="small">54</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 0;">For determining the length of the long side (hypothenuse)
of a right angle triangle, when the other
two given sides are not equal, the foot rule, or another
steel square may be laid diagonally across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[page&nbsp;108]</span>
blade and arm, and applied
directly to the proper graduations
thereon, and the distance
between them measured
on the rule. If the distance
to be measured is in
feet, use the <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">12</span>" graduations
on the back of the
square.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a href="images/193-600.png"><img src="images/193-167.png" width="167" height="500" alt="Fig. 193. Back of Steel Square, Brace Measure." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 193. Back of Steel Square, Brace Measure.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/194-600.png"><img src="images/194-169.png" width="169" height="500" alt="Fig. 194. Face of Steel Square, Octagon, 'Eight-Square,' Scale." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 194. Face of Steel Square, Octagon, "Eight-Square," Scale.</div>

<p>To use the octagonal (or
8-square) scale, Fig. 194, which is along the center
of the face of the tongue, with the dividers, take the
number of spaces in the scale to correspond with the
number of inches the piece of wood is square, and
lay this distance off from the center point, on each
edge of the board. Connect the points thus obtained,
diagonally across the corners, and a nearly exact octagon
will be had. E.g., on a board 12" square,
Fig. 195, find A.B.C.D., the centers of each edge.
Now with the
dividers take 12
spaces from the
8-square scale.
Lay off this distance
on each
side as A' A"
from A, B' B"
from B, etc.
Now connect A"
with B', B" with
C', C" with D',
D" with A', and
the octagon is
obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/195-400.png" width="400" height="435" alt="Fig. 195. Method of Using the Eight-Square Scale on the Steel-Square." /><br /><br />Fig. 195. Method of Using the Eight-Square Scale on the Steel-Square.</div>


<p>In making a
square piece of
timber octagonal, the same method is used on the
butt, sawed true. When the distance from one center
is laid off, the marking-gage may be set to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[page&nbsp;109]</span>
distance from the point
thus obtained to the corner
of the timber, and the piece
gaged from all four corners
both ways. Cutting
off the outside arrises
to the gaged lines leaves an
octagonal stick.</p>

<p>The board-measure is stamped on the back
of the blade of the square, Fig. 196. The figure
12 on the outer edge of the blade is the
starting point for all calculations. It represents
a 1" board, 12" wide, and the smaller figures
under it indicate the length of boards in
feet. Thus a board 12" wide, and 8' long measures
8 square feet and so on down the column.
To use it, for boards other than 12" wide:&mdash;find
the length of the board in feet, under the
12" marked on the outer edge of the blade, then
run right or left along that line to the width of
the board in inches. The number under the
width in inches on the line showing the length
in feet, gives the board feet for lumber 1" thick.</p>

<p>For example, to measure a board 14' long,
and 11" wide,&mdash;under the figure 12, find 14
(length of the board); to the left of this, under
11 is the number 12.10; 12' 10" is the board-measure
of the board in question. Since a board
12' long would have as many board feet in it as
it is inches wide, the B. M. is omitted for 12'
boards. Likewise a board 6' long would have &frac12;
the number of board feet that it is inches wide.
If the board is shorter than the lowest figure
given (8) it can be found by dividing its double
by 2.; e. g., to measure a board 5' long and 9"
wide, take 10 under the 12, run to the left of
the number under 9, which is 7' 6"; &frac12; of this
would be 3' 9", the number of board feet in the
board.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[page&nbsp;110]</span>

<p>If the board to be measured
is longer than any figure
given, divide the length
into two parts and add the
result of the two parts obtained
separately. For example,
for a board 23' long
and 13" wide,&mdash;take 12'&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;13"
=13'; add to it, 11'&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;13"=11' 11"; total,
24'11".</p>

<p>A good general rule is to think first whether
or not the problem can be done in one's head
without the assistance of the square.</p>

<p>The table is made, as its name, Board-Measure
(B. M.) implies, for measuring boards, which
are commonly 1" thick. For materials more than
1" thick, multiply the B. M. of one surface by
the number of inches thick the piece measures.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a href="images/196-600.png"><img src="images/196-169.png" width="169" height="500" alt="Fig. 196. Back of Steel Square, Essex Board Measure." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 196. Back of Steel Square, Essex Board Measure.</div>

<p>The rafter-table is found on the back of
the body of the square, Fig. 197. Auxiliary
to it are the twelfth inch graduations, on the
outside edges, which may represent either feet
or inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/198-400.png" width="400" height="173" alt="Fig. 198. The 'Run' and 'Rise' of a Rafter." /><br /><br />Fig. 198. The "Run" and "Rise" of a Rafter.</div>

<p>By the "run" of the rafter is meant the horizontal
distance when it is set in place from the
end of its foot to a plumb line from the ridge
end, i.&nbsp;e., one half the length of the building,
Fig. 198. By the "rise" of the rafter is meant
the perpendicular distance from the ridge end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[page&nbsp;111]</span>
to the level of the foot of the rafter. By the pitch is meant the
ratio of the rise to twice the run, i.&nbsp;e., to the total width of the
building. In a &frac12; pitch, the rise equals the run, or &frac12; the width of
the building; in a &#8531; pitch the rise is &#8531; the width of the
building; in a &frac34; pitch the rise is &frac34; the width of the building.</p>

<p>To find the length of a rafter by the use of the table, first find
the required pitch, at the left end of the table. Opposite this and
under the graduation on the edge representing the run in feet, will
be found the length of the rafter; e.g., a rafter having a run of 12'
with a &frac14; pitch, is 13' 5" long, one with a run of 11' and a &#8531; pitch,
is 13' 2<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>8</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">12</span>", one with a run of 7' and a &#8541; pitch, is 11' 2<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>6</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">12</span>"
long, etc.</p>

<p>When the run is in inches, the readings are for <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">12</span> of the run
in feet: e.g., a rafter with a run of 12" and a &frac14; pitch is 13<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>5</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">12</span>",
one with a run of 11" and a &#8531; pitch, is 13<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>3</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">12</span>". Where the run
is in both feet and inches, find the feet and the inches separately;
and add together; e.g., a rafter with a run of 11' 6", and a &frac12;
pitch, is 15' 6<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>8</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">12</span>" + 8<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>6</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">12</span>" = 16' 3<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>2</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">12</span>".</p>

<p>The <i>lumberman's board-rule</i>, Fig. 199. To measure wood by it,
note the length of the board in feet at the end of the measure. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[page&nbsp;112]</span>
dot nearest the width (measured in inches) gives the B. M. for lumber
1" thick.</p>

<p>The <i>try-square</i>, Fig. 200, which is most commonly used for measuring
the accuracy of right
angles, is also convenient for
testing the width of a board
at various places along its
length, for making short measurements,
and as a guide in
laying out lines with a pencil
or knife at right angles to a
surface or edge. The sizes are
various and are indicated by
the length of the blade. A
convenient size for the individual
bench and for ordinary
use has a blade 6" long. It
is also well to have in the shop
one large one with a 12" blade.</p>

<p>In testing the squareness of work with the try-square, care must
be taken to see that the head rests firmly against the surface from
which the test is made, and then slipped down till the blade touches
the edge being tested,
Fig. 203. The edge
should be tested at a
number of places in the
same way: that is, it
should not be slid along
the piece. The try-square
is also of great use in
scribing lines across
boards, Fig. 204. A
good method is to put
the point of the knife at
the beginning of the desired
line, slide the
square, along until it
touches the knife-edge; then, resting the head of the square firmly
against the edge, draw the knife along, pressing it lightly against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[page&nbsp;113]</span>
the blade, holding it perpendicularly. To prevent the knife from
running away from the blade of the try-square, turn its edge slightly
towards the blade.</p>

<p><i>Winding-sticks</i>, Fig. 205, consist of a pair of straight strips of
exactly the same width thruout. They are used to find out whether
there is any twist or "wind" in a board. This is done by placing
them parallel to each other, one at one end of the board, and the other
at the other end. By sighting across them, one can readily see
whether the board be twisted or not, Fig. 206. The blades of two
framing-squares may be used in the same manner.</p>

<p><i>Compasses</i> or <i>dividers</i>, Fig. 207, consist of two legs turning on a
joint, and having sharpened points. A convenient form is the wing
divider which can be accurately adjusted by set-screws. A pencil
can be substituted
for the removable
point.
They are used
for describing
circles and arcs,
for spacing, for
measuring, for
subdividing distances,
and for
scribing. In scribing a line parallel with a given outline, one leg
follows the given edge, or outline, and the point of the other, marks
the desired line. Used in this way they are very convenient for marking
out chamfers, especially on curved edges, a sharp pencil being
substituted for the steel point.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[page&nbsp;114]</span>

<p>The <i>beam-compass</i>, Fig. 208, consists of two <i>trammel-points</i> running
on a beam which may be made of any convenient length. It is
used for describing large circles. A pencil may be attached to one
point.</p>

<p><i>Calipers</i>, outside and inside, Figs. 209, 210, are necessary for the
accurate gaging of diameters, as in wood-turning.</p>

<p>The <i>marking-gage</i>, Fig. 211, consists of a head or block sliding
on a beam or bar, to which it is fixed by means of a set-screw. On
the face of the head is a brass shoe to keep the face from wearing.
Projecting thru the beam is a steel spur or point, which should be
filed to a flat, sharp edge, a little rounded and sharpened on the
edge toward which the gage is to be moved, Fig. 212. It should project
about &#8539;" from the beam. If the spur be at all out of place, as
it is likely to be, the graduations on a beam will be unreliable. Hence
it is best to neglect them entirely when setting the gage and always
to measure with the rule from the head to the spur, Fig. 213.</p>

<p>In use the beam should be tilted forward, so as to slide on its
corner, Fig. 214. In this way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[page&nbsp;115]</span>
the depth of the gage line can be regulated. Ordinarily, the finer
the line the better. The head must always be kept firmly pressed
against the edge of the wood so that the spur will not run or jump
away from its desired course. Care should also be taken, except in
rough pieces, to run gage lines no farther than is necessary for the
sake of the appearance of the finished work. To secure accuracy, all
gaging on the surface of wood, should be done from the "working
face" or "working edge."</p>

<p>It is sometimes advisable, as in laying out chamfers, not to mark
their edges with a marking-gage,
because the marks will
show after the chamfer is
planed off. A pencil mark
should be made instead. For
this purpose a pencil-gage may
be made by removing the spur
of a marking-gage, and boring
in its place a hole to receive a
pencil stub with a blunt point,
or a small notch may be cut
in the back end of the beam,
in which a pencil point is held
while the gage is worked as
usual except that its position
is reversed. For work requiring
less care, the pencil may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[page&nbsp;116]</span>
be held in the manner usual in
writing, the middle finger serving
as a guide, or a pair of
pencil compasses may be used,
one leg serving as a guide. A
special gage is made for gaging
curved lines, Fig. 215.</p>

<p>The <i>cutting-gage</i>, Fig. 216, is similar to a marking-gage, except
that it has a knife-point inserted instead of a spur. It is very useful
in cutting up soft, thin wood even as thick as &frac14;".</p>

<p>The <i>slitting-gage</i> is used in a similar
way, but is larger and has a handle.</p>

<p>The <i>mortise-gage</i>, Fig. 217, is a
marking-gage with two spurs, with
which two parallel lines can be drawn
at once, as in laying out mortises. One
form is made entirely of steel having,
instead of spurs, discs with sharpened
edges.</p>

which a hole is bored, is a
satisfactory substitute.</p>

<h4>8. SHARPENING TOOLS.</h4>

<p>The <i>grindstone</i> for woodworking tools is best when rather fine
and soft. The grinding surface should be straight and never concave.
The stone should run as true as possible. It can be made true by
using a piece of 1" gas pipe as a truing tool held against the stone
when run dry. Power grindstones usually have truing devices attached
to them, Fig. 221. A common form is a hardened steel screw, the
thread of which, in working across the face of the grindstone, as they
both revolve, shears off the face of the stone. The surface should
always be wet when in use both to carry off the particles of stone
and steel, and thus preserve the cutting quality of the stone, and to
keep the tool cool, as otherwise, its temper would be drawn, which
would show by its turning blue. But a grindstone should never
stand in water or it would rot.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[page&nbsp;118]</span>

<p>It is well to have the waste from the grindstone empty into a
cisternlike box under it, Fig. 221. In this box the sediment will
settle while the water overflows from it into the drain. Without
such a box, the sediment will be carried into and may clog the drain.
The box is to be emptied occasionally, before the sediment overflows.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/221-474.png" width="474" height="450" alt="Fig. 221. Power Grindstone." /><br /><br />Fig. 221. Power Grindstone.</div>

<p>In order that the tool may be ground accurately, there are various
devices for holding it firmly and steadily against the stone. A
good one is shown in Figs. 221 and 222. This device is constructed
as follows: A board A is made 2" thick, 6" wide, and long enough
when in position to reach from the floor to a point above the level
of the top of the stone. It is beveled at the lower end so as to rest
snugly against a cleat nailed down at the proper place on the floor.
The board is held in place by a loop of iron, B, which hooks into
the holes in the trough of the grindstone. In the board a series of
holes (say 1" in diameter) are bored. These run parallel to the
floor when the board is in place, and receive the end of the tool-holder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[page&nbsp;119]</span>
The tool-holder consists of four parts: (1) a strip C, 1&frac12;"
thick, and as wide as the widest plane-bit to be ground. The forward
end is beveled on one side; the back end is rounded to fit the
holes in the main board A. Its length is determined by the distance
from the edge of the tool being ground to the most convenient hole
in A, into which the rear end is to be inserted. It is better to use
as high a hole as convenient, so that as the grindstone wears down,
the stick will still be serviceable; (2) a strip, D, of the same width
as A and &#8542;" thick, and 15" to 18" long; (3) a cleat, E, &#8541;"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;&frac34;",
nailed across D; (4) a rectangular loop of wrought iron or brass, F,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[page&nbsp;120]</span>
which passes around the farther end of the two strips, C and D, and
is fastened loosely to D by staples or screws.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/222-500.png" width="500" height="368" alt="Fig. 222. Grinding Device." /><br /><br />Fig. 222. Grinding Device.</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/223-600.png" width="600" height="237" alt="Fig. 223. Holder for Grinding Chisels or Plane-Bits." /><br /><br />Fig. 223. Holder for Grinding Chisels or Plane-Bits.</div>

<p>The tool to be ground slips between this loop and the strip C, and
is held firmly in place by the pressure applied to the back end of D,
which thus acts as a lever on the fulcrum E.</p>

<p>Any desired bevel may be obtained on the tool to be sharpened,
by choosing the proper hole in A for the back end of C or by adjusting
the tool forward or backward in the clamp. As much pressure
may be put on the tool as the driving belt will stand without
slipping off.</p>

<p>A still simpler holder for the plane-bit only, is a strip of wood
1&frac12;" thick and 2" wide, cut in the shape G shown in Fig. 223. The
plane-bit fits into the saw-kerf K, and in grinding is easily held
firmly in place by the hand. By inserting the rear end of the stick
G into a higher or lower hole in the board A, any desired angle may
be obtained. G is shown in position in Fig. 221.</p>

<p>All such devices necessitate a perfectly true stone. The essential
features are, to have a rigid support against which the tool may be
pushed by the revolving stone, to hold the tool at a fixed angle which
may be adjusted, and to press the tool against the stone with considerable
pressure. The wheel should revolve toward the edge which
is being ground, for two reasons.
It is easier to hold the
tool steadily thus, and the
danger of producing a wire
edge is lessened. The edge as
it becomes thin, tends to
spring away from the stone
and this tendency is aggravated
if the stone revolves
away from the edge. If the
stone does not run true and
there is a consequent danger
of digging into the stone with
the tool which is being sharpened, the stone would better revolve
away from the edge. The grinding should continue until the ground
surface reaches the cutting edge and there is no bright line left along
the edge. If the grinding is continued beyond this point, nothing is
gained, and a heavy wire edge will be formed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/224-400.png" width="400" height="293" alt="Fig. 224. Agacite Grinder." /><br /><br />Fig. 224. Agacite Grinder.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[page&nbsp;121]</span>

<p>A very convenient and inexpensive grinding tool, Fig. 224, sold
as the "<i>Agacite grinder</i>,"<sup>7</sup> has a number of different shaped grinding
stones made chiefly of carborundum.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 7: Made by the Empire Implement Co., Albany, N. Y.</p>

<p>The <i>oilstone</i>. After grinding, edge tools need whetting. This is
done on the whetstone, or oilstone. The best natural stones are found
near Hot Springs, Arkansas. The fine white ones are called Arkansas
stones, and the coarser ones Washita stones. The latter are better
for ordinary woodworking tools. The <i>India oilstone</i>, an artificial
stone, Fig. 77, <a class="index" href="#page58">p. 58</a>, cuts even more quickly than the natural stones.
It is made in several grades of coarseness. The
medium grade is recommended for ordinary shop
use. Oil is used on oilstones for the same purpose
as water on a grindstone. When an oilstone
becomes hollow or uneven by use, it may
be trued by rubbing it on a flat board covered
with sharp sand, or on sandpaper tacked over a block of wood.</p>

<p><i>Slipstones</i>, Fig. 225, are small oilstones, made into various shapes
in order to fit different tools, as gouges, the bits of molding-planes, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/225-200.png" width="200" height="74" alt="Fig. 225. Slipstone." /><br /><br />Fig. 225. Slipstone.</div>

<p><i>Files</i> are used for sharpening saws, augers, scrapers, etc. See
above, <a class="index" href="#page90">p. 90</a>.</p>


<h4>9. CLEANING TOOLS.</h4>

<p>The <i>bench duster</i>. One may be noted hanging on the bench shown
in Fig. 166, <a class="index" href="#page98">p. 98</a>. Bristle brushes for cleaning the benches are
essential if the shop is to be kept tidy.</p>

<p><i>Buffer</i>. Wherever a lathe or other convenient revolving shaft is
available, a buffer made of many thicknesses of cotton cloth is very
valuable for polishing tools. The addition of a little tripoli greatly
facilitates the cleaning.</p>

<h3>WOOD FASTENINGS.</h3>


<p>The following are the chief means by which pieces of wood are
fastened together: nails, screws, bolts, plates, dowels, glue, hinges,
and locks.</p>


<h4>NAILS</h4>

<p><i>Nails</i>, Fig. 226, may be classified according to the material of
which they are made; as, steel, iron, copper, and brass. Iron nails
may be galvanized to protect them from rust. Copper and brass nails
are used where they are subject to much danger
of corrosion, as in boats.</p>

<p>Nails may also be classified according to the
process of manufacture; as, cut nails, wrought
nails, and wire nails. Cut nails are cut from a
plate of metal in such a way that the width of
the nail is equal to the thickness of the plate,
and the length of the nail to the width of the
plate. In the third dimension, the nail is
wedge-shaped, thin at the point and thick at
the head. Unless properly driven, such nails
are likely to split the wood, but if properly
driven they are very firm. In driving, the
wedge should spread with and not across the
grain.</p>

<p>Wrought nails are worked into shape from hot steel, and have
little or no temper, so that they can be bent over without breaking,
as when clinched. Horseshoe- and trunk-nails are of this sort. They
are of the same shape as cut nails.</p>

<p>Wire nails are made from drawn steel wire, and are pointed,
headed, and roughened by machinery. They are comparatively cheap,
hold nearly if not quite as well as cut nails, which they have largely
displaced, can be bent without breaking, and can be clinched.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[page&nbsp;124]</span>

<p>Nails are also classified according to the shape of their heads;
as, common or flat-heads, and brads or finishing nails. Flat-heads
are used in ordinary work, where the heads are not to be sunk in
the wood or "set."</p>

<p>Some nails get their names from their special uses; as, shingle-nails,
trunk-nails, boat-nails, lath-nails, picture-nails, barrel-nails, etc.</p>

<p>The size of nails is indicated by the length in inches, and by the
size of the wire for wire nails. The old nomenclature for cut nails
also survives, in which certain numbers are prefixed to "penny." For
example, a threepenny nail is 1&frac14;" long, a fourpenny nail is 1&frac12;"
long, a fivepenny nail is 1&frac34;" long, a sixpenny nail is 2" long. In
other words, from threepenny to tenpenny &frac14;" is added for each
penny, but a twelvepenny nail is 3&frac14;" long, a sixteenpenny nail is
3&frac12;" long, a twentypenny nail is 4" long. This is explained as meaning
that "tenpenny" nails, for example, cost tenpence a hundred.
Another explanation is that originally 1000 of such nails weighed
a pound. The size of cut nails is usually still so indicated. Nails
are sold by the pound.</p>

<p>The advantages of nails are that they are quickly and easily applied,
they are strong and cheap, and the work can be separated, tho
with difficulty. The disadvantages are the appearance and, in some
cases, the insecurity.</p>

<p>The holding power of nails may be increased by driving them
into the wood at other than a right angle, especially where several
nails unite two pieces of wood. By driving some at
one inclination and some at another, they bind the
pieces of wood together with much greater force than
when driven in straight.</p>

<p>The term brads was once confined to small finishing
nails, but is now used for all finishing nails,
in distinction from common or flat-headed nails. The
heads are made round instead of flat so that they may
be set easily with a nailset and the hole filled with
a plug, or, where the wood is to be painted, with
putty. They are used for interior finishing and other nice work.</p>

<p><i>Tacks</i>, Fig. 227, vary in size and shape according to their use;
as, flat-headed, gimp, round-headed, and double-pointed or matting
tacks, a sort of small staple. Their size is indicated by the word
"ounce." For example, a two-ounce tack is &frac14;" long, a three-ounce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[page&nbsp;125]</span>
tack is &#8540;" long, a four-ounce tack is <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>7</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span>" long, a six-ounce tack is
&frac12;" long, etc. This term once meant the number of ounces of iron
required to make 1000 tacks.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/227-150.png" width="150" height="238" alt="Fig. 227. Tack." /><br /><br />Fig. 227. Tack.</div>

<p>Tacks are useful only in fastening to wood thin material, such as
veneers, textiles, leather, matting, tin, etc. Tinner's tacks, which are
used for clinching, are commonly called clinch-nails. Wire tacks,
altho made, are not so successful as cut tacks
because they lack a sharp point, which is essential.</p>

<p><i>Corrugated fasteners</i>, Fig. 228, or fluted
nails, are used to fasten together two pieces
of wood by driving the fastener so that one-half
of it will be on each side of the joint.
Their size is indicated by the length and the
number of corrugations, as &frac12;", four. They
are often useful where nails are impracticable.</p>

<p><i>Glaziers' points</i> are small, triangular pieces of zinc, used to fasten
glass into sashes.</p>


<h4>SCREWS</h4>

<p>(a) <i>Wood-screws</i>, Fig. 229, may be classified by the material of
which they are made; as, steel or brass. Steel screws may be either
bright,&mdash;the common finish,&mdash;blued by heat or acid to hinder rusting,
tinned, or bronzed. Brass screws are essential wherever rust
would be detrimental, as in boats.</p>

<p>(b) Screws are also classified by shape; as, flat-headed, round-headed,
fillister-headed, oval-countersunk-headed, and square-headed
screws. Flat-heads are most commonly used. There are also special
shapes for particular purposes. Round-heads may be used either for
decoration or where great drawing power is desirable. In the latter
case, washers are commonly inserted under the heads to prevent them
from sinking into the wood. Oval-heads are used decoratively, the
head filling the countersunk hole, as with flat-heads, and projecting
a trifle besides. They are much used in the interior finish of railway
cars. They are suitable for the strap hinges of a chest.</p>

<p>The thread of the screw begins in a fine point so that it may
penetrate the wood easily where no hole has been bored as is often
the case in soft wood. The thread extends about two-thirds the
length of the screw. Any longer thread would only weaken the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[page&nbsp;126]</span>
screw where it most needs strength, near the head, and it does not
need friction with the piece thru which it passes.</p>

<p>The size of screws is indicated by their length in inches, and by
the diameter of the wire from which they are made, using the standard
screw-gage, Fig. 220, <a class="index" href="#page116">p. 116</a>. They vary in size from No. 0
(less than <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span>") to No. 30 (more than <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>7</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span>") in diameter, and in
length from &frac14;" to 6".</p>

<p>The following is a good
general rule for the use of
screws: make the hole in the
piece thru which the screw
passes, large enough for the
screw to slip thru easily.
Countersink this hole enough
to allow the head to sink flush
with the surface. Make the
hole in the piece into which
the screw goes small enough
for the thread of the screw to
catch tight. Then all the
strength exerted in driving,
goes toward drawing the pieces
together, not in overcoming
friction. The hole must be deep enough, especially in hard wood and
for brass screws, to prevent the possibility of twisting off and breaking
the screw. Soap is often useful as a lubricant to facilitate the driving
of screws. Where it is desirable that the heads do not show, a hole
may first be bored with an auger-bit large enough to receive the head
and deep enough to insert a plug of wood, which is cut out with a
plug-cutter, Fig. 131, <a class="index" href="#page84">p. 84</a>, and glued in place. If pains are taken
to match the grain, the scar thus formed is inconspicuous.</p>

<p>In rough work, the screw may be driven into place with a hammer
thru most of its length, and then a few final turns be given
with a screwdriver, but this breaks the fibers of the wood and weakens
their hold. In "drive-screws," Fig. 229, e, the slot is not cut all the
way across the head, in order that the blows of the hammer may not
close the slot.</p>

<p>The advantages of screws are, that they are very strong and that
the work can easily be taken apart. If they loosen they can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[page&nbsp;127]</span>
retightened. The disadvantages are, that they are expensive, that
they take time to insert, that they show very plainly, and that they
do not hold well in end grain.</p>


<h4>BOLTS</h4>

<p>Bolts with nuts are useful where great strength is desired. There
are three chief varieties, Fig. 230.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/230-200.png" width="200" height="396" alt="Fig. 230. a. Stove-bolt. b. Carriage-bolt. c. Machine-bolt." /><br /></div>

<tr>
       <td class="main">b. Carriage-bolt.</td>

<tr>
       <td class="main">c. Machine-bolt.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><i>Stove-bolts</i> are cheaply made (cast) bolts
having either flat or round heads with a slot for
the screwdriver, like ordinary screws.</p>

<p><i>Carriage-bolts</i> are distinguished by having
the part of the shank which is near the head,
square.</p>

<p><i>Machine-bolts</i> have square, hexagonal, or
button heads.</p>

<p><i>Machine-screws</i>, Fig. 231, are similar to
stove-bolts, but are accurately cut and are measured
with a screw-gage. The varieties are, <i>a</i>,
flat-head, <i>b</i>, round-head, <i>c</i>, fillister-head, <i>d</i>,
oval-countersunk-head,
all with slots for screwdriver.</p>

<p><i>Plates</i>, Fig. 232, include corner-irons, straight
plates and panel-irons. These are made of
either iron or brass and are used in fastening legs to the floor, in
stiffening joints, affixing tops, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/232-600.png" width="600" height="330" alt="Fig. 232. a. Corner-iron. b. Straight plate. c. Panel-iron." /><br /></div>

<p><i>Dowel-rods</i>. Dowel-rods are cylindrical rods, from <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>3</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span>" to 1"
in diameter, and 36", 42", and 48" long. They are commonly made
of birch or maple, but maple is more satisfactory as it shrinks less
and is stronger than birch.</p>

<p>Dowels are used as pins for joining boards edge to edge, and as
a substitute for mortise-and-tenon
joints.</p>

<p>There is, to be sure, a prejudice
against dowels on the
part of cabinet-makers due,
possibly, to the willingness to
have it appear that doweling
is a device of inferior mechanics.
But doweling is
cheaper and quicker than tenoning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[page&nbsp;128]</span>
and there are many places in wood construction where it is
just as satisfactory and, if properly done, just as strong. Certain
parts of even the best furniture are so put together.</p>

<p>Shoe pegs serve well as small dowels. They are dipped in glue
and driven into brad-awl holes.</p>

<p><i>Wedges</i> are
commonly used in
door construction
between the edges
of tenons and the
insides of mortises
which are
slightly beveled,
No. <a class="index1" href="#d34">34</a>, Fig. 266,
<a class="index" href="#page179">p. 179</a>. Or the
end of a tenon
may be split to receive
the wedges, No. <a class="index1" href="#d35">35</a>, Fig. 266. The blind wedge is used in the
fox-tail joint, No. <a class="index1" href="#d36">36</a>, Fig. 266.</p>


<h4>GLUE</h4>

<p>Glue is an inferior kind of gelatin, and is of two kinds,&mdash;animal
glue and fish glue. Animal glue is made of bones and trimmings,
cuttings and fleshings from hides and skins of animals. Sinews,
feet, tails, snouts, ears, and horn pith are also largely used. Cattle,
calves, goats, pigs, horses, and rabbits, all yield characteristic glues.</p>

<p>The best glue is made from hides of oxen, which are soaked in
lime water until fatty or partly decayed matter is eaten out and only
the glue is left. The product is cleaned, boiled down and dried.</p>

<p>The best and clearest bone glues are obtained by leaching the
bones with dilute acid which dissolves out the lime salts and leaves
the gelatinous matters. Such leached bone is sold as a glue stock,
under the name of "osseine." This material together with hides,
sinews, etc., has the gelatin or glue extracted by boiling again and
again, just as soup stock might be boiled several times. Each extraction
is called a "run." Sometimes as many as ten or fifteen runs
are taken from the same kettle of stock, and each may be finished
alone or mixed with other runs from other stock, resulting in a
great variety of commercial glues.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[page&nbsp;129]</span>

<p>Manufacturers use many tests for glue, such as the viscosity or
running test, the odor, the presence of grease or of foam, rate of
set, the melting-point, keeping properties, jelly strength (tested between
the finger tips), water absorption (some glues absorb only
once their weight, others ten or twelve times), and binding or adhesive
tests. This latter varies so much with different materials that
what may be good glue for one material is poor for another.</p>

<p>Putting all these things together, glues are classified from grade
10 to 160, 10 being the poorest. The higher standards from 60 and
upwards are neutral hide glues, clear, clean, free from odor, foam, and
grease. The lower standards are chiefly bone glues, used for sizing
straw hats, etc. They are rigid as compared with the flexibility of
hide glues. For wood joints the grade should be 70 or over. For
leather, nothing less than 100 should be used, and special cements
are better still.</p>

<p>The best glue is transparent, hard in the cake, free from spots,
of an amber color, and has little or no smell. A good practical test
for glue is to soak it in water till it swells and becomes jelly-like.
The more it swells without dissolving the better the quality. Poor
glue dissolves. Glue is sometimes bleached, becoming brownish white
in color, but it is somewhat weakened thereby.</p>

<p>Fish glue is made from the scales and muscular tissue of fish.
Isinglass is a sort of glue made from the viscera and air bladder of
certain fish, as cod and sturgeon.</p>

<p>Liquid glue may be made either from animal or fish glue. The
LePage liquid glue is made in Gloucester, Mass., one of the greatest
fish markets in the country. Liquid glue is very convenient because
always ready, but is not so strong as hot glue, and has an offensive
odor. Liquid glues are also made by rendering ordinary glue non-gelatinizing,
which can be done by several means; as, for instance,
by the addition of oxalic, nitric, or hydrochloric acid to the glue solution.</p>

<p>To prepare hot glue, break it into small pieces, soak it in enough
cold water to cover it well, until it is soft, say twelve hours, and
heat in a glue-pot or double boiler, Fig. 243, <a class="index" href="#page149">p. 149</a>. The fresher
the glue is, the better, as too many heatings weaken it. When used
it should be thin enough to drip from the brush in a thin stream,
so that it will fill the pores of the wood and so get a grip. Two surfaces
to be glued together should be as close as possible, not separated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[page&nbsp;130]</span>
by a mass of glue. It is essential that the glue be hot and the wood
warm, so that the glue may remain as liquid as possible until the
surfaces are forced together. Glue holds best on side grain. End
grain can be made to stick only by sizing with thin glue to stop the
pores. Pieces thus sized and dried can be glued in the ordinary
way, but such joints are seldom good. Surfaces of hard wood that
are to be glued should first be scratched with a scratch-plane, Fig.
111, <a class="index" href="#page79">p. 79</a>.</p>

<p>To make waterproof glue, add one part of potassium bichromate
to fifty parts of glue. It will harden when exposed to the air and
light and be an insoluble liquid.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 8: For recipes for this and other glues, see Woodcraft, May '07, p. 49.</p>

<p><i>General directions for gluing.</i><sup>9</sup> Before applying glue to the parts
to be fastened together, it is a good plan to assemble them temporarily
without glue, to see that all the parts fit. When it is
desirable that a certain part, as the panel, in panel construction,
should not be glued in place, it is a wise precaution to apply wax,
soap, or oil to its edges before insertion. Since hot glue sets quickly,
it is necessary after the glue is applied to get the parts together as
soon as possible. One must learn to work fast but to keep cool. To
expedite matters, everything should be quite ready before the process
is begun, clamps, protecting blocks of wood, paper to protect the
blocks from sticking to the wood, braces to straighten angles, mallet,
try-square, and all other appliances likely to be required.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 9: For special directions, for particular joints, see under the various joints, (Chap. VII.)</p>

<p>Whenever it is possible to break up the process into steps, each
step can be taken with more deliberation. For example, in assembling
framed pieces that are doweled, it is well to glue the dowels
into one set of holes beforehand, making tenons of them, as it were.
Time is thus saved for the final assembling when haste is imperative.
The superfluous glue around the dowels should be carefully wiped off.</p>

<p>Likewise in gluing up framed pieces, sections may be put together
separately: as, the ends of a table, and when they are dry then the
whole may be assembled. When the pieces are together the joints
should be tested to see that they are true, and that there are no
twists.</p>

<p>A good way to insure squareness, is to insert a diagonal brace on
the inside, corner to corner, as in Fig. 294, <a class="index" href="#page196">p. 196</a>. Such a brace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[page&nbsp;131]</span>
should be provided when the trial assembly is made. Another good
way to insure squareness is to pass a rope around two diagonally opposite
posts, and then by twisting the rope, to draw these corners
toward each other until the frame is square.</p>

<p>The superfluous glue may be wiped off at once with a warm damp
cloth, but not with enough water to wet the wood. Or by waiting a
few minutes until the glue thickens, much of it can readily be peeled
off with an edge tool. Either of these ways makes the cleaning easier
than to let the superfluous glue harden.</p>

<p>The work when glued should remain at least six hours in the
clamps to harden.</p>


<h4>HINGES</h4>

<p>Hinges, Fig. 233, are made in several forms. The most common
are the butt-hinge or butt, the two leaves of which are rectangular, as
in a door-hinge; the strap-hinge, the leaves of which are long and
strap-shaped; the Tee-hinge, one leaf of which is a butt, and the
other strap-shaped; the chest-hinge, one leaf of which is bent at a
right angle, used for chest covers; the table-hinge used for folding
table tops with a rule joint; the piano-hinge, as long as the joint;
the blank hinge or screen-hinge which opens both ways; the stop-hinge,
which opens only 90&deg;; and the "hook-and-eye" or "gate"
hinge.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/233-1000.png"><img src="images/233-600.png" width="600" height="167" alt="Fig. 233. Hinges" /></a><br /></div>

<p>The knuckle of the hinge is the cylindrical part that connects the
two leaves, Fig. 234. The "acorn" is the head of the "pintle" or
pin that passes thru the knuckle. Sizes of butts are indicated in
inches for length, and as "narrow," "middle," "broad" and "desk"
for width. The pin may be either riveted into the knuckle as in
box-hinges or removable as in door-butts. Sometimes, as in blind-hinges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[page&nbsp;132]</span>
the pintle is fastened into one knuckle, but turns freely in
the other.</p>

<p>A butt-hinge may be set in one of three positions, Fig. 235: (1)
Where it is desired to have the hinge open as wide as possible, as in a
door. Here the knuckle is set well out from the wood. (2) Where
it is desired to have the hinged portion
open flat and no more. Here the center
of the pin is in line with the outside
surface of the wood. This is less
likely to rack the hinge than the other
two positions. (3) Where it is desired
to have the knuckle project as little as
possible.</p>

<h4>HINGING</h4>

<p>In setting the hinges of a box cover,
first see that the cover fits the box exactly
all the way around.</p>

<p>In the case of a door, see that it fits
its frame, evenly all the way around,
but with a little play. To insure a tighter fit at the swinging edge
this edge should be slightly beveled inwards.</p>

<p>In attaching a butt-hinge, the essential thing is to sink the hinge
into the wood, exactly the thickness of the knuckle. The gains may
be cut in one or both of the pieces to be hinged together.</p>

<p>With these matters determined proceed as follows: In the case
of a box cover, the hinges should be set about as far from the ends
of the box as the hinge is long.</p>

<p>In the case of an upright door, locate the hinges respectively
above and below the lower and upper rails of the door. Mark with
the knife on the edge of the door the length of the hinge, and square
across approximately the width of the gain to receive it. Do this for
both hinges. Between these lines gage the proper width of the gains.
Set another gage to one half the thickness of the knuckle and gage
on the door face the depth of the gains. Chisel out the gains, set
the hinges in place, bore the holes, and drive the screws. Place the
door in position again to test the fit. If all is well, mark the position
of the hinges on the frame, gage and cut the gains, and fasten in the
hinges. Where the hinge is gained its full thickness into the door,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[page&nbsp;133]</span>
no gain, of course, is cut in the frame. If the hinges are set too
shallow, it is an easy matter to unscrew one leaf of each and cut a
little deeper. If they are set too deep the screws may be loosened
and a piece of paper or a shaving
inserted underneath along
the outer arris of the gain.</p>


<h4>LOCKS</h4>

<p>The chief parts of a lock
are: the <i>bolt</i>, its essential feature,
the <i>selvage</i>, the plate
which appears at the edge of
the door or drawer, the <i>box</i>,
which contains the mechanism
including the <i>tumbler</i>, <i>ward</i>,
<i>spring</i>, etc., the key-pin, into
or around which the key is inserted,
the <i>strike</i>, the plate attached
opposite the selvage,
(often left out as in drawer-locks,
but essential in hook-bolt
locks, and self-locking locks,)
and the <i>escutcheon</i>, the plate
around the keyhole.</p>

<p>Locks may be classified: (1) According to their <i>uses</i>, of which
there are two types. (a), Fig. 236, For drawers, cupboards, tills,
wardrobes, and doors. In these the bolt simply projects at right
angles to the selvage into the strike, and resists pressure sidewise of
the lock. (b), Fig. 237, For desks, roll-top desks, chests, boxes and
sliding doors. In these, the bolt includes
a hook device of some kind to
resist pressure perpendicular to the
selvage. In some locks, the hook or
hooks project sidewise from the bolt, in
others the bolt engages in hooks or
eyes attached to the strike.</p>

<p>(2) According to the <i>method of application</i>,
as rim locks, which are fastened on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[page&nbsp;134]</span>
the surface, and mortise locks which are mortised into the
edge of a door or drawer or box.</p>


<h4>INSERTING LOCKS</h4>

<p>To insert a <i>rim-lock</i>, measure the distance from the selvage to the
key-pin, locate this as the center of the keyhole, and bore the hole. If
the lock has a selvage, gain out the edge
of the door or drawer to receive it. If
the lock box has to be gained in, do
that next, taking care that the bolt has
room to slide. Cut the keyhole to the
proper shape with a keyhole-saw or
small chisel. Fasten the lock in place,
and if there is a strike or face-plate,
mark its place and mortise it in.</p>

<p>To insert a <i>mortise-lock</i>, locate and
bore the keyhole, mortise in the box
and the selvage, finish the keyhole, fasten in the lock, add the escutcheon,
locate and mortise in the strike, and screw it in place.</p>

<h3>EQUIPMENT AND CARE OF THE SHOP.</h3>


<p><i>Tool equipment</i>. The choice of tools in any particular shop best
comes out of long experience. Some teachers prefer to emphasize
certain processes or methods, others lay stress on different ones. The
following tentative list is suggested for a full equipment for twenty-four
students. One bench and its tools may be added for the teacher.</p>

<p>The prices given are quoted from Discount Sheet No. 1 for Catalogue
of Tools, No. 355 issued by Hammacher, Schlemmer &amp; Co.,
Fourth Avenue and 13th Street, New York City, dated 1908, and
are correct at the present date (1910). Aggregate orders, however,
are always subject to special concessions, and it is suggested that before
ordering the purchaser submit a list of specifications for which
special figures will be quoted.</p>

<p>There are good benches, vises, and tools of other makes on the
market, but those specified below are typical good ones.</p>

<p>Following are two equipments for classes of twenty-four pupils,
one severely economical to cost approximately $400, and the other
more elaborate to cost approximately $750.</p>

<h4>THE CARE OF THE WOODWORKING SHOP</h4>

<p><i>The general arrangement of the room</i>. The important factors
are the source or sources of light, and the lines of travel. The common
arrangement of benches where two sides of the room are lighted,
is shown in <i>a</i>, Fig. 238. By this arrangement, as each worker faces
his bench, he also faces one set of windows and has another set of
windows at his left. The advantage of this arrangement is that it is
easy to test one's work with the try-square by lifting it up to the
light. Another arrangement, shown in <i>b</i>, Fig. 238, has this advantage,
that there are no shadows on the work when it is lying on the
bench and the worker is holding his rule or try-square on it with
his left hand. When all the windows are on one side of the room
the latter is the more advantageous arrangement.</p>

<p>In determining the position of the benches, especially with reference
to their distance from each other, thought should be given to
the general lines of travel, from the individual benches to the general
tool-rack, to the finishing-table, to the lockers, etc. Even if all the
aisles cannot be wide enough both for passage and for work, one
wider one thru the center of the room may solve the difficulty. Where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[page&nbsp;143]</span>
rooms are crowded, space may be economized by placing the benches
in pairs, back to back, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, Fig. 238. In any case, room
should
always be reserved for a tier of demonstration seats, facing the teacher's
bench, for the sake of making it easy for the pupils to listen and
to think.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/238-393.png" width="383" height="450" alt="Fig. 238. Four Different Arrangements of Benches in a Shop." /><br /><br />Fig. 238. Four Different Arrangements of Benches in a Shop.</div>

<p><i>The Tools</i>. Every shop soon has its own traditions as to the arrangement
of tools, but there are two principles always worth observing.
(1) It is an old saying that there should be "a place for everything
and everything in its place." This is eminently true of a well-ordered
woodworking shop, and there is another principle just as important.
(2) Things of the same sort should be arranged together, and
arranged by sizes, whether they be general tools or individual tools.
In arranging the rack for general tools, a few suggestions are offered.
In the first place, arrange them so that there will be no danger of
cutting one's fingers on one tool when attempting to take down another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[page&nbsp;144]</span>
Where the rack must needs be high, all the tools can be
brought within reach, by placing long tools, like files, screwdrivers,
etc., at the top. Such an arrangement is shown in Fig. 239.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/239-1000.png"><img src="images/239-546.png" width="546" height="450" alt="Fig. 239. General Tool rack in a School Shop." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 239. General Tool rack in a School Shop.</div>

<p>As to the individual benches, those without high backs are to be
preferred, not only because of their convenience when it is desired
to work on large pieces, like table tops, and because the backs do not
interfere with the light, but because it is easier for the teacher to
look over the room to see that everything is in order. If the equipment
is kept complete, it is an easy matter to glance over all the
benches and the general rack to see that everything is in place.</p>

<p>In general, there are two methods of keeping guard over tools, the
open and the closed. In the open method, everything is kept in sight
so that empty places can be discovered readily. This method is a
convenient one, and, besides, the tools are always easily accessible.
In the closed method, the tools are kept in drawers and cases where
they can be locked up. This method is suitable where pupils are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[page&nbsp;145]</span>
equipped with individual sets of cutting tools. In such a case, the
common tools for each bench are kept in a common drawer and individual
pupils' tools in separate drawers. This method has the disadvantage
that things are out of sight, and if they disappear their
loss may not be discovered immediately. On the other hand, where
the drawers and cases are kept carefully locked, the danger of loss is
reduced almost to a minimum. Sometimes a combination of both
methods is tried, the tools being kept in unlocked drawers. This
method furnishes the greatest difficulty in keeping tools from disappearing.</p>

<p>Even when tools are well arranged, one of the most serious difficulties
in the way of shop order, is to keep tools in their places. Pupils
who are in a hurry, slip in the tools wherever they will fit, not
where they belong. Labels at the places of the different sets may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[page&nbsp;146]</span>
help somewhat; a more efficient method is to paste or paint the
form of each tool on the wall or board against which it hangs. Pupils
will see that, when they will not stop to read a label.</p>

<p>In spite of all precautions, some tools will disappear. A plan to
cover the cost of these, which works well in some schools, is to require
a deposit at the beginning of the year to cover these losses. Then at
the end of the year, after deducting the cost of losses, the balance is
returned pro rata.</p>

<p>There is diversity of practice in the distribution of tools on the
general case and on the individual benches. Some tools, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[page&nbsp;147]</span>
plane and chisel, and try-square, are so frequently in use that each
worker must have one at hand. As to others, the demand must determine
the supply. One other consideration may be expressed by
the principle that those tools, the use of which is to be encouraged,
should be kept as accessible as possible, and those whose use is to be
discouraged, should be kept remote. Some tools, like files, it may be
well to keep in a separate locker to be had only when asked for.</p>

<p>A cabinet of drawers, such as that shown in Fig. 240, for holding
nails, screws, and other fastenings, is both a convenience and a material
aid in preserving the order of the shop.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/240-372.png" width="372" height="450" alt="Fig. 240. Nail and Screw Cabinet." /><br /><br />Fig. 240. Nail and Screw Cabinet.</div>

<p>As for the care of tools during vacation, they should be smeared
with vaseline, which is cheap, and put away out of the dampness.
The planes should be taken apart and each part smeared. To clean
them again for use, then becomes an easy matter. The best method
of removing rust and tarnish is to polish the tools on a power buffing
wheel on which has been rubbed some tripoli. They may then be
polished on a clean buffer without tripoli.</p>

<p><i>The Lockers.</i> In order to maintain good order in the shop, an
almost indispensable part of the equipment is a set of lockers for holding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[page&nbsp;148]</span>
the unfinished work of pupils. An inexpensive outfit may consist
simply of sets of shelves, say 5" apart, 12" deep, and 18" long, Fig. 241.
Ordinary spring-roller curtains may be hung in front of each set of
shelves to conceal and protect the contents. Such a case should cost
at the rate of about 40c. for each compartment. A more substantial
and more convenient case, shown in Fig. 242, consists of compartments
each 9&frac12;" high, 6" wide, and 18" deep. These proportions
may be changed to suit varying conditions. In front of each tier
of 12 compartments is a flap door opening downward. Such a case
built of yellow pine (paneled) may cost at the rate of $1.00 per
compartment.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/241-400.png" width="400" height="450" alt="Fig. 241. An Inexpensive Locker for Unfinished Work." /><br /><br />Fig. 241. An Inexpensive Locker for Unfinished Work.</div>

<p>There should, of course, be a separate compartment for each pupil
using the shop. Where possible, there should be a special table
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[page&nbsp;149]</span>
for staining and gluing. Where strict economy must be practiced, a
good sized kitchen table covered with oilcloth answers every purpose.
A better equipment would include a well-built bench, such as that
shown in Fig. 243, the top and back of which are covered with zinc.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/243-1000.png"><img src="images/243-476.png" width="476" height="450" alt="Fig. 243. Gluing and Staining Bench Covered with Zinc." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 243. Gluing and Staining Bench Covered with Zinc.</div>

<p>Where no staining-table is possible, temporary coverings of oilcloth
may be provided to lay over any bench which is convenient for
the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Care of brushes and materials used in finishing wood.</i> Shellac
should be kept in glass or pottery
or aluminum receptacles
but not in any metal like tin,
which darkens it. A good
plan is to have a bottle for
fresh, untouched shellac, a
wide-mouthed jar for that
which has been diluted and
used, and an enameled cup for
use. There should also be a
special brush, Fig. 244. At
the time of using, first see
that the brush is soft and pliable. If it is stiff, it can be soaked
quickly and softened in a little alcohol in the cup. This alcohol may
then be poured into the jar and mixed in by shaking. Then pour out
a little from the jar into the cup, and if it is too thin, thicken with
some fresh shellac. After using, pour back the residue into the jar,
carefully wiping the brush on the edge of the jar; and if it is not
to be used again for some time, rinse it in a little alcohol, which may
also be poured into the jar, which should then be covered. What
little shellac remains in the brush and cup will do no harm and the
brush may be left standing in the cup until required. The important
things are to keep the shellac cup and brush for <i>shellac only</i>,
(indeed, it is a good plan to label them "SHELLAC ONLY,") and
to keep the shellac covered so that the alcohol in it will not evaporate.
In a pattern-making shop, where the shellac cup is to be frequently
used, it is well to have cups with covers thru which the
brushes hang, like the brush in a mucilage jar.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/244-400.png" width="400" height="280" alt="Fig. 244. Shellac Utensils." /><br /><br />Fig. 244. Shellac Utensils.</div>

<p>Varnish brushes need to be cleaned thoroly after each using. If
they get dry they become too hard to be cleaned without great difficulty.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[page&nbsp;150]</span>

<p>Brushes for water stains are easily taken care of by washing with
water and then laying them flat in a box. Cups in which the water
stains have been used can also be easily rinsed with water.</p>

<p>Brushes for oil stains are
most easily kept in good condition,
by being hung in a
brush-keeper, Fig. 245, (sold
by Devoe &amp; Reynolds, 101
Fulton St., N. Y. C.) partly
filled with turpentine. The
same brushes may also be used
for fillers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/245-282.png" width="282" height="450" alt="Fig. 245. Brush-keeper." /><br /><br />Fig. 245. Brush-keeper.</div>

<p>Oil stains should be poured
back into their respective bottles,
and the cups wiped out
with cotton waste. When they
get in bad condition, they can
be cleaned readily after a preliminary
soaking in a strong
solution of potash. The same
treatment may be given to
brushes, but if they are left
soaking too long in the solution,
the bristles will be eaten
off.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">CHAPTER VII.</span></h2>

<h3>THE COMMON JOINTS.</h3>


<p>Wherever two or more pieces of wood are fastened together we
have what is properly called joinery. In common usage the term indicates
the framing of the interior wood finish of buildings and ships,
but it is also used to include cabinet-making, which is the art of constructing
furniture, and even the trades of the wheelwright, carriage-maker,
and cooper. Since joinery involves the constant use of joints,
a reference list of them, with illustrations, definitions, uses, and directions
for making typical ones may be of convenience to workers
in wood.</p>


<h4>HEADING JOINTS</h4>
<a name="d1" id="d1"></a>
<p><i>No. 1. A lapped and strapped joint</i> is made by
laying the end of one timber over another and fastening them both
together with bent straps on the ends of which are screws by which
they may be tightened. It is a very strong joint and is used where
the beams need lengthening as in false work or in long ladders and
flag poles.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/264-01.png" width="600" height="213" alt="Fig. 264-1 Lapped and Strapped" /><br /><br />Fig. 264-1 Lapped and Strapped</div>
<a name="d2" id="d2"></a>
<p><i>No. 2. A fished joint</i> is made by butting the squared
ends of two timbers together and placing short pieces of wood or iron,
called fish-plates, over the faces of the timbers and bolting or spiking
the whole firmly together. It is used for joining timbers in the direction
of their length, as in boat construction.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/264-02.png" width="500" height="198" alt="Fig. 264-2 Fished" /><br /><br />Fig. 264-2 Fished</div>
<a name="d3" id="d3"></a>
<p><i>No 3.</i> In a <i>fished joint</i> keys are often inserted between
the fish-plate and beam at right angles to the bolts in order to lessen
the strain that comes upon the bolts when the joint is subjected to
tension. In wide pieces and for extra strength, as in bridge work, the
bolts may be staggered.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/264-03.png" width="600" height="222" alt="Fig. 264-3 Fished and keyed" /><br /><br />Fig. 264-3 Fished and keyed</div>
<a name="d4" id="d4"></a>
<p><i>Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7.</i> <i>A scarf or spliced joint</i> is made by
joining together with flush surfaces the ends of two timbers in such
a way as to enable them to resist compression, as in No. 4; tension,<a name="d5" id="d5"></a>
as in No. 5; both, as in No. 6, where the scarf is tabled; or cross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[page&nbsp;152]</span>
strain as in No. 7. No. 4 is used in house sills and in splicing out
short posts, Nos. 5 and 6 in open frame work. <i>No. 7</i> with or without
the fish-plate, is used in boats and canoes, and is sometimes called a
boat-builder's joint, to distinguish it from No. 4, a carpenter's joint.
A joint to resist cross strain is stronger when scarfed in the direction
of the strain than across it. No. 7 is the plan, not elevation, of a
joint to receive vertical cross strain.</p>

<h4>BUTT JOINTS</h4>
<a name="d8" id="d8"></a>
<p><i>No. 8. A doweled butt-joint</i> is made by inserting, with
glue, dowel-pins into holes bored into the two members. The end of
one member is butted against
the face or edge of the other.
It is used in cabinet-making
where the presence of nails
would be unseemly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/264-08.png" width="550" height="375" alt="Fig. 264-8 Dowelled butt" /><br /><br />Fig. 264-8 Dowelled butt</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="margin-top: 3em;"><img src="images/246-405.png" width="405" height="450" alt="Fig. 246. Lay-out by Thru Dowling." /><br /><br />Fig. 246. Lay-out by Thru Dowling.</div>

<p>In a doweled butt-joint the
dowels may go clear thru the
outside member, and be finished
as buttons on the outside,
where they show. To lay
out this joint mark near the
ends of the edges of the abutting
member, X, Fig. 246, center-lines
A B. Draw on the
other member Y, a sharp pencil-line
to which when the
lines AB on X are fitted, X will be in its proper place. Carry the
line around to the other side of Y and locate on it the proper centers
for the dowel-holes E and F. Then fasten on the end of X a handscrew
in such a way that the jaws will be flush with the end. With
another handscrew, clamp this handscrew to Y in such a way that the
marks on the two pieces match, A to C and B to D, Fig. 247.
Bore at the proper places, E and F, holes directly thru Y into X.</p>

<p>Fig. 248 illustrates the gluing together of a four-legged stand in
which the joints are made in this way. The cross-lap joints of the
stretchers are first glued together, then the other joints are assembled
without glue, to see that all the parts fit and finally two opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[page&nbsp;153]</span>

sides are glued at a time. Pieces of paper are laid inside the gluing
blocks to prevent them from sticking to the legs.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/248-600.png" width="600" height="426" alt="Fig. 248. Gluing-Up a Four-Legged Stand." /><br /><br />Fig. 248. Gluing-Up a Four-Legged Stand.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[page&nbsp;154]</span>
<p>In case the dowels are to be hidden the chief difficulty is to locate
the holes properly. One method of procedure is as follows: To
dowel the end of one member
against the face of the other as
a stringer into a rail or a rail
into a table leg, first lay out
the position of the dowels in
the end of the first member,
X, Fig. 249. Gage a center-line,
A B, across this end lengthwise,
locate the centers of the
dowel-holes, and square across
with a knife point, as CD and
EF. Gage a line on the other
member to correspond with the
line AB. On the face so
gaged, lay the first member on
its side so that one arris lies
along this gaged line and prick off the points D and F, to get the
centers of the dowel-holes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/249-414.png" width="414" height="450" alt="Fig. 249. Laying out a Dowel Joint." /><br /><br />Fig. 249. Laying out a Dowel Joint.</div>

<p>If, as is usual, there are a number of similar joints to be made,
a device like that shown in Fig. 249 will expedite matters. 1 and
2 are points of brads driven thru a piece of soft wood, which has been
notched out, and are as far apart as the dowels. A-1 is the distance
from the working edge of the rail to the first dowel. The same
measure can be used from the end of the leg.</p>

<p>When the centers are all marked, bore the holes. Insert the
dowels into the holes and make a trial assembly. If any rail is
twisted from its proper plane, note carefully where the error is, take
apart, glue a dowel into the hole, that is wrong, pare it off flush with
the surface, and re-bore in such a place that the parts, when assembled
will come up true. When everything fits, glue and clamp together.</p>
<a name="d9" id="d9"></a>
<p><i>No. 9. A toe-nailed joint</i> is made by driving nails
diagonally thru the corners of one member into the other. It is used
in fastening the studding to the sill in balloon framing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/264-09.png" width="450" height="371" alt="Fig. 264-9 Toe-nailed" /><br /><br />Fig. 264-9 Toe-nailed</div>
<a name="d10" id="d10"></a>

<p><i>No. 10. A draw-bolt joint</i> is made by inserting an iron
bolt thru a hole in one member and into the other to meet a nut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[page&nbsp;155]</span>
inserted from the side of the second member. It is very strong and
is used in bench construction, wooden machinery, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/264-10.png" width="400" height="388" alt="Fig. 264-10 Draw-bolt" /><br /><br />Fig. 264-10 Draw-bolt</div>
<a name="d11" id="d11"></a>
<p><i>No. 11. A plain butt-joint</i> is one in which the members
join endwise or edgewise without overlapping. It is used on
returns as in ordinary boxes and cases.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/264-11.png" width="400" height="228" alt="Fig. 264-11 Plain butt" /><br /><br />Fig. 264-11 Plain butt</div>
<a name="d12" id="d12"></a>
<p><i>No. 12. A glued and blocked joint</i> is made by gluing
and rubbing a block in the inside corner of two pieces which are
butted and glued together. It is used in stair-work and cabinet-work,
as in the corners of bureaus.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/264-12.png" width="350" height="288" alt="Fig. 264-12 Glued and blocked" /><br /><br />Fig. 264-12 Glued and blocked</div>
<a name="d13" id="d13"></a>
<p><i>No. 13. A hopper-joint</i> is a butt-joint, but is peculiar
in that the edges of the boards are not square with their faces on
account of the pitch of the sides. It is used in hoppers, bins, chutes,
etc. The difficulty in laying out this joint is to obtain the proper
angle for the edges of the pieces. This may be done as follows:
After the pieces are planed to the correct thickness, plane the upper
and lower edges of the end pieces to the correct bevel as shown by
the pitch of the sides. Lay out the pitch of the sides of the hopper
on the outside of the end pieces. From the ends of these lines, on
the upper and lower beveled edges score lines at right angles with
the knife and try-square. Connect these lines on what will be the
inside of the hopper. Saw off the surplus wood and plane to the
lines thus scored. The side pieces may be finished in the same way,
and the parts are then ready to be assembled.</p>

<h4>HALVING-JOINTS</h4>

<p>A halved joint is one in which half the thickness of each member
is notched out and the remaining portion of one just fits into the
notch in the other, so that the upper and under surfaces of the members
are flush.</p>
<a name="d14" id="d14"></a>
<p><i>No. 14. A cross-lap joint</i> is a halved joint in which
both members project both ways from the joint. This is a very common
joint used in both carpentry and joinery, as where stringers
cross each other in the same plane.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/264-14.png" width="600" height="464" alt="Fig. 264-14 Cross lap" /><br /><br />Fig. 264-14 Cross lap</div>

<p>The two pieces are first dressed exactly to the required size,
either separately or by the method of making duplicate parts, see
Chap. IX, <a class="index" href="#page204">p. 204</a>. Lay one member, called X, across the other in
the position which they are to occupy when finished and mark plainly
their upper faces, which will be flush when the piece is finished.
Locate the middle of the length of the lower piece, called Y, on one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[page&nbsp;156]</span>
arris, and from this point lay off on this arris half the width of the
upper piece, X. From this point square across Y with the knife
and try-square. Lay X again in its place, exactly along the line
just scored. Then mark with the knife on Y the width of X, which
may then be removed and the second line squared across Y. From
these two lines square across both edges of Y to approximately one-half
the thickness. Now turn X face down, lay Y on it, and mark
it in the same way as Y. Set the gage at one-half the thickness of
the pieces, and gage between the lines on the edges, taking care to
hold the head of the gage against the marked faces. Then even if
one piece is gaged so as to be cut a little too deep, the other will be
gaged so as to be cut proportionately less, and the joint will fit.</p>

<p>Cut a slight triangular groove on the waste side of the knife-marks,
Fig. 91, <a class="index" href="#page66">p. 66</a>, saw accurately to the gaged lines, and chisel
out the waste as in a dado, see Figs. 70 and 71, <a class="index" href="#page56">p. 56</a>.</p>

<p>The bottom of the dado thus cut should be flat so as to afford
surface for gluing. When well made, a cross-lap joint does not need
to be pounded together but will fit tight under pressure of the hands.</p>
<a name="d15" id="d15"></a>
<p><i>No. 15. A middle-lap joint or halved tee</i> is made in
the same way as a cross-lap joint, but one member projects from the
joint in only one direction, it is used to join stretchers to rails as
in floor timbers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/265-15.png" width="600" height="434" alt="Fig. 265-15 Middle lap" /><br /><br />Fig. 265-15 Middle lap</div>
<a name="d16" id="d16"></a>
<p><i>No. 16. An end-lap joint</i> is made in the same way as a
cross-lap joint except that the joint is at the end of both members. It
is used at the corners of sills and plates, also sometimes in chair-seats.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/265-16.png" width="600" height="328" alt="Fig. 265-16 End lap" /><br /><br />Fig. 265-16 End lap</div>

<p>To make an end-lap joint, place the members in their relative
positions, faces up, and mark plainly. Mark carefully on each member
the inside corner, allowing the end of each member slightly (<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span>")
to overlap the other. Square across at these points with a sharp
knife point, on the under side of the upper member, and on the
upper side of the lower member. Now proceed as in the cross-lap
joint, except that the gaged line runs around the end and the cutting
must be done exactly to this line.</p>
<a name="d17" id="d17"></a>
<p><i>No. 17.</i> In an <i>end-lap joint on rabbeted pieces</i> the
joint must be adapted to the rabbet. The rabbet should therefore
be plowed before the joint is made. The rabbet at the end of the
piece X is cut not the entire width of the piece Y, but only the width
of the lap,&mdash;c-f = a-e. This joint is used occasionally in picture-frames.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/265-17.png" width="500" height="285" alt="Fig. 265-17 End lap with rabbet" /><br /><br />Fig. 265-17 End lap with rabbet</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[page&nbsp;157]</span>
<a name="d18" id="d18"></a>
<p><i>No. 18. A dovetail halving or lap-dovetail</i> is a middle-lap

able to resist tension. It is used for strong tee joints.</p>

<a name="d21" id="d21"></a>
<p><i>No. 21. A checked joint or double notch</i> is made by
cutting out notches from both the timbers so as to engage each
other. It is used where a single notch would weaken one member
too much.</p>

<p><i>No. 22. A cogged or corked or caulked joint</i> is made
by cutting out only parts of the notch on the lower piece, leaving a
"cog" uncut. From the upper piece a notch is cut only wide enough
to receive the cog. A cogged joint is stronger than a notched because
the upper beam is not weakened at its point of support. It is used
in heavy framing.</p>

<p><i>No. 23. A forked tenon joint</i> is made by cutting a
fork in the end of one member, and notching the other member to
fit into the fork, so that neither piece can slip. It is used in knock-down
furniture and in connecting a muntin to a rail, where it is
desired that the muntin should run thru and also that the rail be
continuous.</p>

<p><i>No. 24. A rabbet or rebate or ledge joint</i> is made by
cutting out a portion of the side or end of a board or timber X to
receive the end or side of another, Y. It may then be nailed from
either the side or end or from both. The neatest way in small boxes
is from the end, or better still it may be only glued.</p>

<p><i>No. 25. A dado or grooved joint</i> is made by cutting
in one member a groove into which the end or edge of the other
member fits. Properly speaking a groove runs with the grain, a
dado across it, so that the bottom of a drawer is inserted in a groove
while the back of the drawer is inserted in a dado. Where the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[page&nbsp;158]</span>
of the end of one member is let into the other, such a dado is also
called a housed dado. Treads of stairs are housed into string boards.</p>

<p>To lay out a dado joint: After carefully dressing up both pieces
to be joined, locate accurately with a knife point, on the member to
be dadoed, called X, one side of the dado, and square across the piece
with a try-square and knife. Then locate the other side of the dado
by placing, if possible, the proper part of the other member, called Y,
close to the line drawn. If this method of superposition is not possible,
locate by measurement. Mark, with a knife point, on X, the
thickness thus obtained. Square both these lines as far across the
edges of X as Y is to be inserted. Gage to the required depth on
both edges with the marking-gage.</p>

<p>To cut the joint: First make with the knife a triangular groove
on the waste side of each line, as indicated in Fig. 91, <a class="index" href="#page66">p. 66</a>, and
starting in the grooves thus made, saw with the back-saw to the gaged
lines on both edges. The waste may now be taken out either with a
chisel or with a router, Fig. 122, <a class="index" href="#page83">p. 83</a>. The second member, Y,
should just fit into a dado thus made, but if the joint is too tight,
the cheeks of the dado may be pared with a chisel. In delicate work
it is often wise not to saw at all, but to use only the knife and chisel.</p>
<a name="d26" id="d26"></a>
<p><i>No. 26. A dado and rabbet</i> is made by cutting a dado
in one member, X, and a rabbet on the other, Y, in such a way that
the projecting parts of both members will fit tight in the returns of
the other member. It is used in boxes and gives plenty of surface
for gluing.</p>

<a name="d28" id="d28"></a>
<p><i>No. 28. A dovetail dado or gain</i> is made by cutting
one or both of the sides of the infitting member, Y, on an angle so
that it has to be slid into place and cannot be pulled out sidewise.
It is used in book-cases and similar work, in which the shelves are
fixed.</p>

<p>To make this joint, first lay out the dovetail on the member to
be inserted, called Y, thus: Across one end square a line (A B,
No. 28), at the depth to which this member is to be dadoed in. Set
the bevel-square at the proper angle for a dovetail, Fig. 250. Score
this angle on the edges of the member, as at C D. Cut a groove with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[page&nbsp;159]</span>
a knife on the waste side of A B. Saw to the depth A C, and chisel
out the interior angle A C D.</p>

<p>Then lay out the other member, X, thus: mark with the knife the
proper place for the flat side of
Y, square this line across the
face and on the edges as for a
simple dado. Lay out the
thickness of Y on the face of
X by superposition or otherwise
and square the face and edges,
not with a knife but with a
sharp pencil point. Gage the
required depth on the edges.
Now with the bevel-square as already
set, lay out the angle A C D
on the edges of X, and across
the face at C score a line with
knife and try-square. Cut out
grooves in the waste for the
saw as in a simple dado, and
saw to the proper depth and at
the proper angle. Chisel or
rout out the waste and when
complete, fit the pieces together.</p>

<a name="d29" id="d29"></a>
<p><i>No. 29. A gain joint</i> is a dado which runs only
partly across one member, X. In order to make the edges of both
members flush and to conceal the blind end of the gain, the corner
of the other member, Y, is correspondingly notched out. In book
shelves a gain gives a better appearance than a dado.</p>

<p>A gain joint is laid out in the same way as the dado, except that
the lines are not carried clear across the face of X, and only one
edge is squared and gaged to the required depth. Knife grooves are
made in the waste for starting the saw as in the dado. Before sawing,
the blind end of the gain is to be chiseled out for a little space
so as to give play for the back-saw in cutting down to the required
depth. To avoid sawing too deep at the blind end, the sawing and
chiseling out of waste may be carried on alternately, a little at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[page&nbsp;160]</span>
time, till the required depth is reached. It is easy to measure the
depth of the cut by means of a small nail projecting the proper
amount from a trial stick, Fig. 251. The use of the router, Fig. 122,
<a class="index" href="#page83">p. 83</a>, facilitates the cutting, and insures an even depth.</p>

<h4>MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINTS</h4>

<p>The tenon in its simplest form is made by dividing the end of a
piece of wood into three parts and cutting out rectangular pieces on
both sides of the part left in the middle. The
mortise is the rectangular hole cut to receive the
tenon and is made slightly deeper than the
tenon is long. The sides of the tenon and of
the mortise are called "cheeks" and the "shoulders"
of the tenon are the parts abutting against
the mortised piece.</p>
<a name="d30" id="d30"></a>
<p><i>No. 30. A stub mortise-and-tenon</i> is made by cutting
only two sides of the tenon beam. It was formerly used for lower
ends of studding or other upright pieces to prevent lateral motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/266-30.png" width="400" height="343" alt="Fig. 266-30 Stub mortise and tenon" /><br /><br />Fig. 266-30 Stub mortise and tenon</div>
<a name="d31" id="d31"></a>
<p><i>No. 31. A thru mortise-and-tenon</i> is made by cutting
the mortise clear thru one member and by cutting the depth of the
tenon equal to or more than the thickness of the mortised member.
The cheeks of the tenon may be cut on two or four sides. It is used
in window sashes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/266-31.png" width="480" height="380" alt="Fig. 266-31 Thru mortise and tenon" /><br /><br />Fig. 266-31 Thru mortise and tenon</div>

<p>A thru mortise-and-tenon joint is made in the same way as a
blind mortise-and-tenon (see below), except that the mortise is laid
out on the two opposite surfaces, and the boring and cutting are done
from both, cutting first from one side and then from the other.</p>
<a name="d32" id="d32"></a>
<p><i>No. 32. A blind mortise-and-tenon</i> is similar to the
simple mortise-and-tenon described in 30. The tenon does not extend
thru the mortised member and the cheeks of the tenon may be
cut on two or four sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/266-32.png" width="550" height="500" alt="Fig. 266-32 Blind mortise and tenon" /><br /><br />Fig. 266-32 Blind mortise and tenon</div>

<p>To make a blind mortise-and-tenon, first make the tenon thus:
Locate accurately with a knife point the shoulders of the tenon and
square entirely around the piece. On the working edge near the end
mark the thickness of the tenon. Set the marking-gage at the proper
distance from the working face to one cheek of the tenon and gage
the end and the two edges between the end and the knife-lines. Reset
the gage to mark the thickness of the tenon and gage that in the same
way from the working face. Then mark and gage the width of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[page&nbsp;161]</span>
tenon in the same way. Whenever there are several tenons of the
same size to be cut, they should all be laid out together, that is the
marking-gage set once to mark all face cheeks and once to mark all
back cheeks. If a mortise-gage is available, use that. Always mark
from the working face or working edge. Cut out a triangular groove
on the waste side of the knife lines (at the shoulders) as in cutting a
dado, Fig. 91, <a class="index" href="#page66">p. 66</a>.</p>

<p>In cutting the tenon, first rip-saw just outside the gaged lines,
then crosscut at the shoulder lines. Do all the rip-sawing before the
crosscutting. If the pieces are small the back-saw may be used for
all cuts. It is well to chamfer the arrises at the end of the tenon to
insure its starting easily into the mortise.</p>

<p>Locate the ends of the mortise and square lines across with a
sharp pencil in order to avoid leaving knife marks on the finished
piece. Then locate the sides of the mortise from the thickness of the
tenon, already determined, and gage between the cross lines. As in
the case of like tenons, if there are a number of mortises all alike,
set the gage only twice for them all.</p>

<p>In <i>cutting the mortice</i>, first fasten the piece so that it will rest
solid on the bench. This may be done either in a tail vise or by a
handscrew, or by clamping the bench-hook firmly in the vise in such a
way that the cleat of the bench-hook overhangs the piece. Then tap
the bench-hook with a mallet and the piece will be found to be held
tightly down on the bench. See Fig. 76, <a class="index" href="#page58">p. 58</a>.</p>

<p>It is common to loosen up the wood by first boring a series of adjoining
holes whose centers follow the center-line of the mortise and
whose diameter is slightly less than the width of the mortise. Take
care to bore perpendicularly to the surface, see Fig. 137, <a class="index" href="#page86">p. 86</a>, and
no deeper than necessary. Dig out the portions of wood between the
auger holes and chisel off thin slices, back to the gage-lines and to
the knife-lines, taking care all the time to keep the sides of the mortise
perpendicular to the face. This may be tested by placing the
chisel against the side of the mortise and standing alongside it a
try-square with its head resting on the surface.</p>

<p>Finally test the tenon in the mortise noting carefully where it
pinches, if anywhere, and trim carefully. The tighter it fits without
danger of splitting the mortised member, the stronger will be the joint.</p>

<p>Many prefer to dig mortises without first boring holes. For this
purpose a mortise-chisel, Fig. 68, <a class="index" href="#page54">p. 54</a>, is desirable. The method is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[page&nbsp;162]</span>
to begin at the middle of the mortise, placing the chisel&mdash;which
should be as wide as the mortise&mdash;at right angles to the grain of the
wood. Chisel out a V shaped opening about as deep as the mortise,
and then from this hole work back to each end, occasionally prying
out the chips. Work with the flat side of the chisel toward the middle
except the last cut or two at the ends of the mortise.</p>

<p><i>No. 34. A wedged mortise-and-tenon joint</i> is a thru
joint in which after the tenon is driven home, wedges are driven in
between the tenon and the sides of the mortise. The wedges are
dipped in glue or white lead before being inserted. The sides of the
mortise may be slightly dovetailed. It is used to keep a tenon tightly
fixed as in wheel spokes.</p>

<p><i>No. 35. A wedged mortise-and-tenon joint</i> may also be
made by driving the wedges into saw kerfs in the tenon instead of
along its sides as in No. 34. It is used in ornamental joints as well as
in carpentry.</p>

<p><i>No. 36. A fox-tail tenon</i> is a blind mortise-and-tenon
in which the mortise is made slightly wider at the bottom than the
width of the tenon. Wedges are driven into saw kerfs in the tenon
before inserting into the mortise; then when it is driven home the
wedges spread out the tenon and make it fill out the mortise. It is
used in strong doors and also where the mortised member is already
in place so that a wedged mortise-and-tenon is impossible.</p>

<p><i>No. 37. A dovetail mortise-and-tenon</i> is a thru
mortise-and-tenon beveled on one side so as to form half a dovetail. The
corresponding side of the mortise is also beveled and made wide
enough so that when the tenon is pressed well up against its beveled
side a wedge may be driven into the space left on the straight side.
It is used to tenon a beam into a post especially where the post is
fixed against a wall. It is also used in machinery frames which are
made of wood.</p>

<p><i>No. 39. A keyed mortise-and-tenon</i> is one in which the
tenon protrudes thru the mortise far enough to receive a removable
key and thus be drawn up tight to the mortised member. It is used
in work-benches and in ornamental joints like knock-down bookcases
and in other mission furniture.</p>

<p>The keyed mortise-and-tenon is made as in a thru mortise-and-tenon,
except that before cutting the tenons the holes for wedges
should be laid out thus: measuring
from the shoulder of the tenon, locate
by superposition or measurement the
outside of the mortised member. Deduct
from this <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span>" and square a fine
pencil-line across the face and opposite
side. This line will be the inside of
the hole for the wedge, and the <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">16</span>"
is deducted to make sure that the key
wedges against the mortised member.
On the upper surface of the tenon, lay
off toward the end the width of the
wedge at this point, A B, Fig. 252,
and square across. On the under surface,
lay off the width of the wedge at
this point, C D, and square across.</p>

<p><i>No. 40. A tusk tenon or shoulder tenon</i> is one in which
the tenon proper is quite thin but is reinforced by a thicker shoulder
called a "tusk." The upper shoulder is beveled. The object of this
form is to weaken the mortised member as little as possible but at
the same time to increase the strength of the tenon. It is used in
joining tail beams to headers in floor framing.</p>

<p><i>No. 42. A haunched mortise-and-tenon</i> is made by
cutting away part of the tenon so that that part of it will be much
shorter than the rest. The haunch gives the tenon great lateral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[page&nbsp;164]</span>
strength and saves cutting so large a mortise hole. It is used in
panel construction, as where the rails are joined to the stiles of doors.</p>

<p>First plow the groove in all the members. This should be of the
same width as the thickness of the tenons, which is ordinarily one-third
of the thickness of the frame. The groove is approximately as
deep as it is wide. Lay out and cut the tenon the width of the entire
piece, minus, of course, the depth of the groove. The mortise should
not come too near the end, or the portion of wood outside it will
shear out. Hence the tenon is narrowed on the outside enough to
insure strength in the mortised piece. The rule is that the tenon
should be one-half the width of the rail, minus the groove. But
enough of the tenon is left full width to fill up the groove at the
outer end of the mortised piece. This is called the <i>haunch</i>. The
width of the mortise is equal to the width of the groove, its length
to the width of the tenon. Before assembling the panel frame, put
soap or tallow on the corners of the panel to prevent its being glued
to the frame.</p>

<h4>DOVETAIL JOINTS</h4>

<p>"Dovetail" refers to the shape of the projections of one member,
when looked at broadside. These projections are called dovetails, or
merely tails.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[page&nbsp;165]</span>

<p>The projections on the other member are called tenons or pins,
and the spaces between both tails and tenons are called mortises or
sockets.</p>
<a name="d47" id="d47"></a>
<p><i>No. 47. A thru single dovetail</i> is similar to a slip-joint
except that instead of a tenon there is a dovetail. It is used in window-sashes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/267-47.png" width="250" height="233" alt="Fig. 267-47 Thru single dovetail" /><br /><br />Fig. 267-47 Thru single dovetail</div>
<a name="d48" id="d48"></a>
<p><i>No. 48. A thru-multiple dovetail</i> consists of a series of
alternate tails and tenons which fit one another closely. It is used
in tool-chests and in other strong as well as fine boxes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/267-48.png" width="400" height="372" alt="Fig. 267-48 Thru multiple dovetail" /><br /><br />Fig. 267-48 Thru multiple dovetail</div>

<p>To make a thru multiple dovetail joint, first square lines with a
sharp pencil around the ends of both members to locate the inner ends
of the dovetails and the pins, d e on X, Fig. 250, and l m on Y.
The distance of this line from the ends of each member may, if desired,
be slightly (<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">32</span>") greater than the thickness of the other
member. Divide this line, d e, on the member to be dovetailed, X,
into as many equal spaces as there are to be tails (dovetails). From
the division points of these spaces, a b c, to the right and left lay off
one-half of the greatest width of the mortises to be cut out, and also
the same distance from d and from e, as at f f f f and g g g g.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/250-700.png"><img src="images/250-270.png" width="270" height="450" alt="Fig. 250. Laying Out a Dovetail Joint." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 250. Laying Out a Dovetail Joint.<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">(Transcriber's Note: Fig. 250. repeated here for clarity)</span></div>

<p>The strongest arrangement of dovetails is to make them equal in
width to the spaces between them, as in No. <a class="index1" href="#d48">48</a>, <a class="index" href="#page165">p. 165</a>. For the
sake of appearance they may be as much as four times as wide as
the spaces, but ordinarily should not be wider than 1&frac34;".</p>

<p>Set the bevel-square so that it will fit the angle A B C, Fig. 250,
<a class="index" href="#page159">p. 159</a>, in a right angle triangle, the long side of which is 3" and the
short side &#8541;". This is approximately an angle of 80&deg; or a little
more than one to five. From the points f f f f and g g g g lay off
this angle to the end of the piece. Carry these lines across the end
at right angles to the surface, h i, Fig. 250, and repeat the dovetail
angles on the other surface. Mark plainly the parts to be cut out
(the mortises), as on X in Fig. 250. Score with a knife point the inner
ends of the mortises, d to f, g to f, etc., and across the edge at d
and at e. With a dovetail-saw, Fig. 93, <a class="index" href="#page67">p. 67</a>, cut on the mortise
side of each line down to the cross line, d-e, and also along the cross
line from d to f and e to g. Chisel out the mortises taking care to
keep the line d-e straight and square. The ends (not the sides) of
the mortises may be slightly undercut to insure a tight fit.</p>

<p>Fasten the other member, Y, upright in the vise so that the end to
be tenoned will be flush with the top of the bench, and with the working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[page&nbsp;166]</span>
face toward the bench. Place on it the working face of X, (the
member already dovetailed,) taking care that the inner ends of the
mortises are in line with the working face of Y, and that the edges of
the two members are in the same plane, as X on Y in Fig. 250. Scribe
with a knife point along the sides of the tails on the end of Y (f'-j'
and g'-h'). Remove Y from the vise and square down these lines to
the cross line l-m (j'-n and h'-o). Score with the knife point the
inner ends of the mortises of Y (n-o). Saw with a dovetail-saw on
the mortise sides of these lines, chisel out the mortises and fit the
parts together. When glued together, the joints should be dressed off.</p>

<p>Where there are several parts to be made alike, it is necessary to lay
out the dovetails on only one X member. This may be used as a
templet for laying out the others and they can then be sawn separately.
Or all the X members may be clamped carefully together,
with one X already laid out, rights and lefts in pairs, and edges and
ends flush, the depth mark gaged all around, and then all sawn at once.</p>

<p>The dovetail joint is also made by first laying out and cutting the
members having the pins, and then superposing this on the piece to
be dovetailed, and scribing around the pins.</p>
<a name="d49" id="d49"></a>
<p><i>No. 49. A lap or half blind dovetail</i> is a dovetail joint
in which the tails on one member do not extend entirely thru the
thickness of the other member. It is used in joining the sides to the
fronts of drawers and other fittings where only one side is seen.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/267-49.png" width="250" height="301" alt="Fig. 267-49 Lap dovetail" /><br /><br />Fig. 267-49 Lap dovetail</div>

<p>If the joint is to be used for a drawer front, the groove for the
drawer bottom should be cut or at least laid out before laying out the
joint. See also drawers, <a class="index" href="#page190">p. 190</a>, and Fig. 287, <a class="index" href="#page191">p. 191</a>. On the
end of the drawer front, gage the depth of the joint. Gage the same
distance on both broad surfaces of the drawer sides, marking from the
front ends. Lay out and cut the dovetails as in a thru dovetail joint,
taking especial care to have the groove for the bottom completely
within the lower tail. Take care also to make the sides, one right
and one left, not both alike, so that the groove will come inside. Lay
out the drawer front by superposing the dovetailed side, X, on the
end of the front, Y, as in a thru dovetail. Saw and chisel out the
mortises and fit together.</p>
<a name="d50" id="d50"></a>
<p><i>No. 50. A stopped lap dovetail</i> is one in which neither
the tails nor the pins extend thru the other members. Hence the
joint is concealed. The lap may be rounded. It is used in fine
boxes, trays, etc.</p>

<p><i>No. 51. The blind miter or secret dovetail</i> is a joint
in which only part, say one-half, of both boards is dovetailed, the
outer portion being mitered. The edges of the boards are also mitered
right thru for a short distance so that when finished the dovetails are
invisible. It is used in highly finished boxes.</p>

<h4>BEVELED JOINTS</h4>

<p>A beveled joint is made by beveling the members so that the plane
of the joint bisects the angle at which the members meet. This is
called the "miter" and may be
45 degrees or any other angle.
It is a neat but weak joint
unless reinforced by a spline,
nails, or in some other way.</p>


<a name="d52" id="d52"></a>
<p><i>No. 52. A plain miter</i> is a joint where the
beveled edges or ends abut and
are simply glued or nailed together.
It is commonly used
in picture-frames, inside trim,
columns, boxes, and taborets, four or more sided.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/268-52.png" width="500" height="390" alt="Fig. 268-52 Miter" /><br /><br />Fig. 268-52 Miter</div>

<p>For gluing mitered frames, the most convenient way is with the
aid of the picture-frame-vise, Fig. 172, <a class="index" href="#page101">p. 101</a>. Nails are driven or
splines inserted as soon as each joint is glued. Where this vise is
not available, an ordinary metalworking vise may be used, as follows:
Fasten one member, X, face side up, firmly in the vise. Bore holes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[page&nbsp;168]</span>
in the other member, Y, at the proper places for the nails. Insert
nails in the holes, apply the glue to both mitered surfaces, place the
glued surfaces together, letting Y project about &#8539;" beyond X. A
convenient way to hold Y in place is in the left hand, palm up, while
the left forearm rests upon X. Drive one of the nails home, and
continue driving until the parts exactly fit. Then drive home the
other nail. Now fasten together in the same way the other two members
of the picture-frame, and then, one at a time, the third and
fourth joint. This is the method used in picture-frame factories,
and when once learned is very simple.</p>

<p>For gluing together at once all the members of a mitered frame,
the device shown in Fig. 253 is convenient and is easily made.
Out of two pieces of wood somewhat longer than the two end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[page&nbsp;169]</span>
pieces of the frame, gains are cut of the exact length of the ends, as
shown in the illustration. By applying two clamps lengthwise on
the frame, all four joints may be glued together at once. If the
frame does not come up square, it may be squared by means of a
temporary brace, A, in Fig. 253.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/253-400.png" width="400" height="235" alt="Fig. 253. Gluing Together a Picture-Frame (See also Fig. 254.)" /><br /><br />Fig. 253. Gluing Together a Picture-Frame (See also Fig. 254.)</div>

<p>The device shown in Figs. 254 and 255, is also an easily made and
efficient tool. At least the small pieces, which receive the corners of
the frame, should be made of hard wood such as maple. It is self-adjusting
but care must be taken not to buckle the parts of a narrow
frame by over pressure. It is well to soap or oil the corner pieces to
prevent their being glued to the frame.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="margin-top: 3em;"><img src="images/254-500.png" width="500" height="288" alt="Fig. 254. Picture-Frame-Clamp." /><br /><br />Fig. 254. Picture-Frame-Clamp.</div>

<p>In gluing together long mitered joints, in six or eight sided taborets
or columns, in which the members meet edgewise, one method is
to wrap a few turns of bale wire around the parts and drive in
wedges under the wire to obtain pressure, Fig. 256. Another method
is to wrap a stout rope, such
as is used for window weights,
around all the pieces, properly
set up, then to tighten it by
twisting it with a stick thru
a loop, Fig. 257. A still more
effective way is by means of
the Noxall Column Clamp, a
powerful device, used chiefly
for gluing up such pieces as the
pillar of a centrally supported
table, Fig. 259. Care must be
taken with all these devices to
protect the corners, unless they
are to be rounded off afterward.
A good way to protect them is
with pieces fastened together in
the shape shown in Fig. 258, b,
and Fig. 257, the interior angle
being equal to the exterior
angle of the piece to be glued.
In the case of a taboret with
slender legs, care must be taken to insert blocks between the separate
legs as well, to brace them apart and to keep them from bending under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[page&nbsp;170]</span>
the pressure. These methods have the advantage that they are
speedy, since all the pieces go together at once; but unless the pieces
fit exactly the joints will not close.</p>

<p>Another method is to glue and clamp the pieces of the taboret together
two by two, using blocks as shown in Fig. 258, <i>a</i>. Care
should be taken to put the pressure of the handscrews as far out as
possible so as to be sure that the outside of the joint closes. This
method has the advantage that, as only one joint is glued at a time,
the work can be done more deliberately. Moreover, if when three
pairs of a six-sided taboret are together, the other three joints do not
fit exactly, they can then be refitted.</p>

<p>Another method is to glue pieces of soft wood on the exterior of
each pieces as shown in Fig. 258, <i>c</i>. These blocks should be of such
shape that the opposite sides of each pair are parallel. When the
glue is dry, they are used as corners on which to clamp the handscrews.
This method has the
disadvantage that the blocks
may break loose at a critical
moment.</p>

<p>In addition to any of these
methods of tightening the
joints, to make sure that the
ends of the joints close tight,
pinch-dogs, Fig. 178, <a class="index" href="#page102">p. 102</a>,
may be driven into the end
grain, and corrugated fasteners,
Fig. 228, <a class="index" href="#page125">p. 125</a>, also driven
into the ends, make the joint
quite secure.</p>

<p>To make this joint, first the boards are all laid down flat, side by
side, and arranged in the proper order. Three considerations determine
what this order is to be: (1), if the grain is of prime importance,
as in quartered oak, then the boards are arranged so as to give
the best appearance of the grain. (2), if possible, the boards should
be so arranged that the warping of each board shall counteract that
of the adjacent ones. For this purpose the boards are so laid that
the annual rings of one shall alternate in direction with the annual
rings of the next, Fig. 280, a, <a class="index" href="#page186">p. 186</a>. (3), if possible, the boards
should be so arranged that after being glued together they can all be
planed smooth in the same direction. When the above requirements
have been met so far as possible, this order should be marked on adjoining
edges for later identification. The edges of the boards to be
joined should be finished with a jointer.</p>

<p>There are two principal methods of gluing edge-to-edge joints,
rubbing and squeezing. In a rubbed joint, the surfaces to be joined
should be planed so as to meet thruout exactly. After properly planing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[page&nbsp;173]</span>
one edge of each board, keep one board in the vise, jointed edge
up, and place its to-be neighbor in position upon it. Then use these
four tests for an exact fit. (1) Sight down the end to see that the
faces lie in the same plane.
(2) Examine the crack from
both sides. Be sure that both
ends touch. Test this by pulling
down hard on one end
of the upper board and noticing
if the other end is still in contact.
If the other end opens,
swing the upper board horizontally
on the lower board to
see where the high place is and
then correct it. (3) See if
the upper board stands firmly on the lower board by feeling gently
to see if it rocks, or by rapping lightly the lower board. (4) Slide
the top board slowly on the lower one to see if it adheres or "sucks."</p>

<p>After the pieces have been warmed, which should be done if possible,
the glue is spread on them, Fig. 260, and they are then rubbed
slowly back and forth in the
direction of the grain, pressure
being applied by the hand
and care being taken not to
open the joint in the least.
As the glue sets, the rubbing
becomes more difficult. It
should be stopped when the
boards are in their proper
relative positions. In rubbing
together the edges of
two boards, handscrews may
be fastened to one in such a
way that their jaws serve
as guides for the other board
to slide between, Fig. 261. Care must be taken to make the jaws of
the handscrew diverge enough not to pinch the upper board.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/261-400.png" width="400" height="368" alt="Fig. 261. Rubbing a Glued Joint." /><br /><br />Fig. 261. Rubbing a Glued Joint.</div>

<p>Another method is to clamp a spare board alongside and projecting
above the lower board. This spare board acts as a guide against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[page&nbsp;174]</span>
which the upper board can be pushed as it is rubbed back and forth.
The rubbed joint is especially suitable for short boards.</p>

<p>In joining long boards, a squeezed joint is common. In this case,
the edges are planed so as to be very slightly concave from end to end.
The object of this is to counteract the subsequent shrinkage which is
likely to take place at the ends of the boards before it does at the
middle. The pressure of the clamps may be depended upon to close
up the middle, and, especially if dowels are inserted, as in No. <a class="index1" href="#d75">75</a>, the
joint will be strong enough to resist the elasticity of the boards.</p>

<p>When the fit is good, warm the wood if possible, prepare the
clamps, put a thin film of glue over both edges which are to be together,
apply the clamps rapidly, keeping the faces flush, and set
away to dry for at least six hours. Then another piece may be added
in the same manner. If the boards are thin and wide, and therefore
likely to buckle, they may first be handscrewed to cross-strips to prevent
their buckling. The cross-strips are, of course, slightly shorter
than the combined width of the boards so that the full pressure of
the clamps may come on the glued joint.</p>
<a name="d71" id="d71"></a>
<p><i>No. 71. A rebated, rabbeted or fillistered joint</i>. Rebating
is the cutting of a rectangular slip out of the side of a piece of
wood. The re-entering angle left upon the wood is called the rebate
or rabbet. A rebated joint, then, is one in which corresponding rebates
are taken off edges so that
the joined boards may overlap.
It is used in flooring and siding.</p>

<p>A board is rebated and filleted
when two adjoining rebates
are filled with a fillet.</p>

<a name="d72" id="d72"></a>
<p><i>No. 72. A matched or
tongue-and-groove joint</i> is made by making a projection
or "tongue" in the center
of the edge of one board,
and a corresponding groove in the center of the other so that they
will match together. When used for flooring, the lower side of the
grooved board is slightly rebated so that the upper edges will surely
touch. This sort of flooring can be blind-nailed.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[page&nbsp;175]</span>
<a name="d73" id="d73"></a>
<p><i>No. 73. A beaded joint</i> is similar to a matched joint
except that a bead is worked on one edge to disguise the joint for
decorative purposes.</p>

<a name="d74" id="d74"></a>
<p><i>No. 74. A spline-joint</i> is made by plowing corresponding
grooves in the edges to be joined and inserting a spline or slip-feather.
It is used in plank flooring.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/269-74.png" width="600" height="150" alt="Fig. 269-74 Spline" /><br /><br />Fig. 269-74 Spline</div>
<a name="d75" id="d75"></a>
<p><i>No. 75. A doweled joint</i> is made by jointing the two
edges carefully, boring holes opposite each other and inserting dowel
pins when the two edges are glued together. It is used in table
tops, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/269-75.png" width="600" height="164" alt="Fig. 269-75 Doweled" /><br /><br />Fig. 269-75 Doweled</div>

<p>Where the boards are thick enough to allow it, a squeezed joint
is greatly strengthened by the insertion of dowels.</p>

<p>The essential point in inserting dowels is to have the holes for
them directly opposite one another and at right angles to the surface.
The following is a convenient method
where boards are to be joined edge to
edge, Fig. 262. Place the two boards
back to back in the vise with the edges
and ends flush. Determine approximately
where the dowels are to be inserted.
With the gage, mark short lines
at the points of insertion in the center
of each edge, gaging from the outside
faces. Across these lines score accurately
with a try-square and knife.
Then bore the holes with a dowel-bit at
the intersection of the lines, Fig. 263.
If this is carefully done, the holes will
be directly opposite one another, and
equidistant from the faces of both
boards. All the holes should be of
equal depth, say 1", in order that the
dowel-pins, which should also be cut of
equal lengths, may be interchangeable. After boring, the holes may
be slightly countersunk in order to insure a tight joint and the easy
slipping of the pins into place. The latter result may also be obtained
by slightly pointing the pins with a dowel-pointer, Fig. 123,
<a class="index" href="#page83">p. 83</a>. It is also a wise precaution to cut a small groove along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[page&nbsp;176]</span>
length of the pin to allow superfluous glue to escape from the hole.
The dowel should be dipped in glue and inserted when the glue is
applied to the joint.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">Chapter VIII.</span></h2>

<h3>TYPES OF WOODEN STRUCTURES.</h3>


<p>The articles suitable to be made in wood with hand tools may for
convenience be divided into four general classes: (1) Unjoined
pieces; (2) board structures; (3) panel structures; (4) framed
structures. A few illustrations of each class are given below.</p>


<h4>(1) SIMPLE OR UNJOINED PIECES</h4>

<p>Of these there are a number that are advantageous for the learning
of tool processes; at the same time they give opportunity for
expression in design, and when finished are of use.</p>

<p>Examples are: key-boards, chiseling-boards, bread-boards, sleeve-boards,
ironing-boards, coat- and skirt-hangers, and gouged trays.
Some of these are so simple as to include hardly any process but
planing, directions for which are given above, <a class="index" href="#page72">p. 72</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/270-400.png" width="400" height="196" alt="Fig. 270. Pen-Tray." /><br /><br />Fig. 270. Pen-Tray.</div>

<p>Where there is more
than one process involved,
the order of procedure is
of importance. In general,
a safe rule to follow
in each case is to plane up
the piece true and square,
or, in technical language,
to "true" it up. At least
as many of its surfaces
should be trued as are necessary for the "lay out." Where the piece
is to be rectangular all the surfaces should be true; where some of
the surfaces are to be curved it is unnecessary and a waste of time
to square them first. For example, in making a gouged tray with
curved outline, Fig. 270, the working face, the working edge, and
the thickness should all be true before the plan is laid out. Then,
after the outline is drawn, the trough may be gouged, the outline cut
with turning-saw, chisel, and spokeshave, and the edges molded with
the gouge or chisel. If there is incised decoration it should be cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[page&nbsp;184]</span>
before the molding is cut, so that while being incised, the piece will
lie flat without tipping.</p>

<p>These simple pieces, as well as others, are often embellished by
<i>chamfering</i>. A chamfer is a surface
produced by cutting away an arris. It
differs from a bevel in that a bevel inclines
all the way to the next arris,
while a chamfer makes a new arris,
Fig. 271. A thru chamfer extends the
whole length or width of a piece, while
a stop chamfer extends only part way.
For the laying out of a chamfer see
<a class="index" href="#page115">p. 115</a>.</p>

<p>Thru chamfering is best done with a plane, Fig. 272. For this
purpose the piece may be held in the bench-vise and the plane tipped
to the proper angle, or the piece may be held in a handscrew which
in turn is held in the vise as in Fig. 175, <a class="index" href="#page101">p. 101</a>. The chamfers with
the grain should be planed before those across the grain.</p>

<p>In chamfering a four-square stick into an eight-square, the piece
may be gripped in the vise diagonally, Fig. 273, or it may be held in
a trough made of two strips of wood from each of which an arris has
been chamfered and then the
two nailed together, Fig. 274.
A dowel or nail may be inserted
in the trough for a stop.
Stop chamfers are pared best
with a chisel, Fig. 275, held
according to convenience either
flat side or bevel side up. See
under chisel, <a class="index" href="#page53">p. 53</a>.</p>

<h4>(2) BOARD STRUCTURES.</h4>

<p>These include such pieces
as wall brackets, sets of shelves,
book-racks, plate-racks, drawing-boards, foot-stools, taborets, and boxes.</p>

<p>The advantage of this form of construction is that it is comparatively
easy to make; the disadvantage is that if the boards are wide,
they are sure to shrink and swell. It is wise in all such work to true
and smooth up all the pieces at once, and if the wood is not thoroly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[page&nbsp;185]</span>
seasoned, to keep the boards under pressure till they are assembled.
In the case of several boards to be jointed into one piece, they should
be glued together before the surfaces are
smoothed. Suggestions regarding a few typical
pieces follow:</p>

<p><i>Wall Brackets.</i> (1) There are three essential
parts, the shelf, the support or supports,
and the back: the shelf to hold the articles,
the support to hold up the shelf, and the back
to hold all together, Fig. 276, <i>a</i>. The grain of
the wood in the shelf should run left and right, not forward and back,
because thus it rests on the support in such a way as not to break
easily, and it also acts as a stiffener for
the back. In case the back extends above
the shelf, as in Fig. 276, <i>a</i>, the shelf can
be secured firmly to the back, since there
is side grain in which to drive nails or
screws. As to the direction of the grain
of the support and the back, this should
run in the direction of the largest dimension
of each. Where the back is
long horizontally, for security in hanging,
it is better to have two supports.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p><i>Wall book-shelves</i>, Fig. 277, <i>plate-racks</i>, etc., are simply
compound
brackets. The shelf is the essential piece, the sides take the
place of the supports, and the
back is often reduced to strips
merely wide enough to give
rigidity.</p>

<p>The shelves may be either
gained into the supports, Fig.
266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d28">28</a> or No. <a class="index1" href="#d29">29</a>, <a class="index" href="#page179">p. 179</a>,
or a keyed mortise-and-tenon
may be used, Fig. 277. In the
latter case the back strip may
have a short barefaced blind
tenon which is mortised into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[page&nbsp;186]</span>
the upright, Fig. 278. It also fits into a rabbet on the upper back
side of the shelf. Made in this way the shelves can be knocked down
easily.</p>

<p><i>Foot Stool or Cricket</i>, Fig.
279. The grain of the supports
should run up and down, because
pieces with the grain horizontal
would be likely to break
under pressure. Braces or a
rail give additional support.
The top should not be larger
than the base of the legs; otherwise
a person standing carelessly
on the stool is in danger
of being upset.</p>

<p><i>A Drawing-Board</i> is made
up of narrow boards, with glued
joints, with the boards so laid
that the annual rings will alternate
in direction, Fig. 280, <i>a</i>. It must be made so that it can
shrink and swell and yet remain flat. For the purpose of giving
lateral stiffness cleats are added. They may simply be screwed on
the underside, the screw holes being large enough to allow for shrinkage,
or they may be dadoed in
with a dovetail dado, Fig. 280,
<i>b</i>, or they may be grooved to
admit a tongue on the end of
a board, Fig. 280, <i>c</i>. In this
case screws passing thru large
holes in the cleats hold them
in place.</p>

<p><i>Taborets.</i> The term taboret
originally meant a little tabor
or drum, and was therefore
used to designate a small stool,
the seat of which consisted of
a piece of stretched leather.
The term now includes small, tablelike structures for holding flowerpots,
vases, etc. It might more properly be called a "table-ette."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[page&nbsp;187]</span>

<p>When made up with boards having their long edges mitered, it
has from four to eight sides. A six-sided one is shown in Fig. 281.
In making, it is best to fit the joints exactly first, while the board is
stiff, and then to cut
out the pattern of the
legs. Directions for gluing
are given on <a class="index" href="#page169">p. 169</a>.</p>

<p><i>Scrap-boxes</i>, Fig. 282,
<i>and flower-pot boxes</i>
may be made with the
same construction.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/282-350.png" width="350" height="446" alt="Fig. 282. Scrap-Box." /><br /><br />Fig. 282. Scrap-Box.</div>

<p><i>Rectangular Boxes.</i>
There are various methods
of joining their
sides. The butt joint,
Fig. 264, No. <a class="index1" href="#d11">11</a>, <a class="index" href="#page177">p. 177</a>,
is plain, simple,
and good for coarse
work. This joint may
be reinforced as in
packing boxes, Fig. 283.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/283-500.png" width="500" height="390" alt="Fig. 283. Reinforced Butt Joint in Box." /><br /><br />Fig. 283. Reinforced Butt Joint in Box.</div>

<p>Mitered joints, Fig. 268, No. <a class="index1" href="#d52">52</a>, <a class="index" href="#page181">p. 181</a>, are neat but weak, unless
reinforced by a spline, Fig. 268, No. <a class="index1" href="#d54">54</a>.</p>

<p>The rabbet or ledge joint, Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d24">24</a>, <a class="index" href="#page179">p. 179</a>, is both strong
and neat. It can be glued and also nailed if desired.</p>

<p>The rabbet and dado joint, Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d26">26</a>, can be glued without
nails and is good for small boxes.</p>

<p>The housed dado, Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d25">25</a>, is good for water-tight boxes.</p>

<p>The mitered ledge, Fig. 268, No. <a class="index1" href="#d58">58</a>, makes a very neat, strong
joint which can be nailed or glued, but is
more difficult to fit than a simpler joint.</p>

<p>The dovetail joint, Fig. 267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d48">48</a>,
is very strong and honest, but the joint
is prominent from the outside and it
takes much time and labor to make.
It is glued.</p>

<p>The blind dovetail, Fig. 267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d51">51</a>,
is very neat and strong, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[page&nbsp;188]</span>
joint is entirely concealed when done, but is very difficult to make.</p>

<p><i>The Bottoms of Boxes.</i> The plain or full bottom, Fig. 284, A,
is likely to shrink (see dotted line), and it is held in place only by
the friction of the nails. The
extended bottom, Fig. 284, B,
overcomes the objection to
shrinkage and adds a decorative
feature. The bottom may be
set in, Fig. 284, C. This is
stronger than the plain bottom,
but the nail holes show. The
bottom may be rabbeted in,
Fig. 284, D. This is better
than the set-in bottom so far as
the showing of the nail holes goes, for the nails may be driven in
from below, and a little shrinkage is not conspicuous. It is practicable,
if a rabbet or mitered joint is used in the sides, but if the side
pieces are butted or dadoed, the rabbet for the bottom shows. This
may be cleverly concealed by
an insert, but that is patchwork,
and not first-rate construction.</p>

<p>Reinforced bottom, Fig. 284, E.
A plain or full bottom
is sometimes covered by a base
or cover strip to hide the joint
and secure the bottom, as in
tool chests. This strip may
be mitered at the corners.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/284-600.png" width="600" height="160" alt="Fig. 284. Methods of Attaching Box Bottoms." /><br /><br />Fig. 284. Methods of Attaching Box Bottoms.</div>

<p><i>The Lids of Boxes.</i> The
simplest form is a full flat
cover, Fig. 285, A, which may
be nailed or screwed to the
box, as in packing cases. The
cover may slide into a groove,
Fig. 285, B, along the sides
and into one end, the other end being lowered to admit it. The
cover may have cleats on its underside, Fig. 285, C, which fit just
inside the box and keep the top in place. The cleats also prevent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[page&nbsp;189]</span>
top from warping. This is a common Japanese construction, even
in fine boxes. The Japanese tie the top on with a tape or ribbon.</p>

<p>The lid may be boxed, Fig. 285, D, that is, portions of the sides
may be affixed to the top. These extra
pieces are a help to stiffen the top and
to keep it from warping. A boxed top
may have the top board flush with the
sides, Fig. 285, E. The disadvantage of
this is that the top may shrink and part
from the sides and give a bad appearance.
The overlapping top, Fig. 285, F,
obviates this trouble of shrinkage and
adds a decorative element. In this case
the top may be glued on or screwed
from below thru the side strips.</p>

<p>The top may be mitered into the
sides, Fig. 285, G. The shrinkage trouble
still obtains here. Otherwise the
appearance is excellent. The top may be paneled into the sides, Fig.
285, H. This has a good appearance if the sides are mitered and ledged
but not if the sides are butted or dadoed, because then the groove for
the top shows.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/285-1000.png"><img src="images/285-600.png" width="600" height="221" alt="Fig. 285. Forms of Box Construction." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 285. Forms of Box Construction.</div>

<p>Any of these lids may be made removable or hinged, except the
sliding top. For methods of hinging see <a class="index" href="#page132">p. 132</a>.</p>

<p>In gluing boxes together, it
is a good plan to glue the ends
and sides together first and to
let these joints dry before
gluing on the bottom and, in
the case of a boxed top, Fig. 285, D,
the top. Care must be
taken to see that the sides do
not bow under the pressure.
To prevent this, one or more
false, temporary partitions as
A, B, in Fig. 286, of exactly
the length to keep the sides
straight, may be inserted. In gluing together boxes with rabbeted
joints, Fig. 285, H, pressure should be applied in both directions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[page&nbsp;190]</span>
In gluing on the bottom of a box that is also to be nailed, the nails
should be driven into the bottom first, so that the points just come
thru. These points sticking into the sides will prevent the bottom
from slipping when pressure is applied. It is often undesirable to
have nail heads show, as in a top. In such a case, and also to prevent
the top from slipping under pressure, a couple of small brads
may be driven part way into the upper edges of the sides, the heads bitten
off with the nippers, and points filed on the projecting portion.</p>

<p><i>Drawers.</i> In the best form, the sides are dovetailed to the front
for strength, Fig. 287, for whenever the drawer is opened the front
tends to pull away from the sides. This dovetail is half blind, so
that the joint will not appear when the drawer is shut. In order that
the drawer may always run freely and yet the front fit the opening as
close as possible, it is common practice to cut a shallow rabbet on
the ends of the front, so that the body of the drawer is a little narrower
than the front is long, Fig. 287. Or the front may be attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[page&nbsp;191]</span>
to the sides with a dado tongue and rabbet joint, Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d27">27</a>, <a class="index" href="#page179">p. 179</a>.</p>

<p>The bottom is grooved into the sides with its grain parallel to
the front and fastened only to the front so that it has plenty of play
for shrinkage. The back is dadoed into the sides, with either a
straight dado,
Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d25">25</a>, <a class="index" href="#page179">p. 179</a>, or
dovetail dado,
Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d28">28</a>,
and rests
on the bottom.
The extension
of the bottom
beyond the
back allows ample
room for
shrinkage.</p>

<p>The best machine-made drawers are now made with the bottom
paneled or dadoed in all around so that papers cannot slip out. The
back, as well as the front, is dovetailed.</p>

<p><i>Directions for Making a Table Drawer.</i> Dress the front and sides
to size. Fit the front of the drawer to its place in the table or cabinet,
leaving a little play all around it. Plow the groove in the front and sides
for the drawer bottom. For ordinary drawers, a groove &frac14;" wide is
proper. If the ends
of the front are to be
rabbeted (see above),
do this next. The
sides are best joined
to the front with the
half-blind dovetail
joint. (For directions
see <a class="index" href="#page166">p. 166</a>). After
fitting these, lay out
and cut the dadoes for
the back of the drawer.
Prepare the bottom of
the drawer thus: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[page&nbsp;192]</span>
grain should run right and
left, never front and back. If
the drawer is so long as to require
it, glue-joint the bottom,
and fit it snugly to place.
There need be no play right
and left, and the bottom should
extend as far back as the sides.
If necessary, bevel the under
side to fit the grooves. Assemble
all the parts to see that they
fit, take them apart, glue the
sides to the front and back,
slip the bottom into place, apply
the clamps, and see to it
that all joints are square, using
a diagonal brace if necessary,
Fig. 294. Fasten the bottom to the front by means of a thin block
glued into the interior angle between the under side of the bottom
and the back side of the front. When dry, clean up the drawer and
fit it to its place.</p>


<h4>(3) PANEL STRUCTURES</h4>

<p>These include doors and cabinets of all sorts. The principle of
panel or cabinet construction is that there shall be a frame composed
of narrow members whose grain follows the principal dimensions.
In the best construction this frame is mortised and tenoned together
and within this frame there is set a thin board or
panel which is free to shrink or swell but is prevented
from warping by the stiffer frame. The
object is to cover an extended surface in such a way
that the general dimensions and good appearance
will not be affected by whatever shrinkage there is.
Since the frame itself is made up of narrow pieces,
there is but little shrinkage in them. That shrinkage
is all that affects the size of the whole structure,
because wood does not shrink longitudinally to any appreciable
extent. The shrinking or swelling of the panel does not affect
the general size. The cross construction of the frame also prevents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[page&nbsp;193]</span>
warping, since, in the
best construction every joint is
mortised and tenoned. The
panel may simply be fastened
on the back of the frame, but a
better construction is to insert
it in a groove made in the inside
of the frame in which the
panel is to lie and have free
play. The panel may be made
of one board or of matched
boards, may be plain or have
raised or carved surfaces, or be
of glass; and the joints between frame and panel may be embellished
with moldings mitered in, but the principle is the same in all cases.</p>

<p>The frame of a door, Fig. 288, illustrates
the panel construction. The
upright, outside pieces are called the
"stiles," the horizontal pieces the "rails."
There are also the "top-rail," the "bottom-rail,"
the "lock-rail" (where the
door-knob and lock are inserted), and
sometimes the "frieze-rail" between the
lock rail and the top rail. The "muntin"
is the upright between the two
stiles.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/288-405.png" width="405" height="450" alt="Fig. 288. Door, Illustrating Panel Construction." /><br /><br />Fig. 288. Door, Illustrating Panel Construction: S. Stile; T. R. Top Rail; L. R. Lock Rail; B. R. Bottom Rail; M. Muntin; P. Panel; A. Double Mortise-and-Tenon; F. Fillet; A. B. C. Forms of Panels.</div>


<p>The joint commonly used is the
haunched or relished mortise-and-tenon,
Fig. 267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d42">42</a>, <a class="index" href="#page180">p. 180</a>; (See
<a class="index" href="#page163">p. 163</a> for directions for making). The
tenon is sometimes doubled, Fig. 288,
and a fillet (f) may be inserted to cover
the ends of the tenons, or the joint may
be a blind mortise-and-tenon, Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d32">32</a>,
or in cheap construction, dowels
may be used. The best doors are now
made with cores of pine covered on the
visible sides with heavy veneer. Large
surfaces are covered by increasing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[page&nbsp;194]</span>
number of parts rather than
their size, as in wainscoting.</p>

<p>Picture-frames also belong
in this class of structures, the
glass taking the place of the
panel. They are made with
mortise-and-tenon joints, Fig.
266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d33">33</a>, slip joints, Fig.
267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d46">46</a>, dowelled butt
joints, Fig. 264, No. <a class="index1" href="#d8">8</a>, end lap
joints, Fig. 265, No. <a class="index1" href="#d17">17</a>, and,
far more commonly, mitered
joints, Fig. 268, No. <a class="index1" href="#d52">52</a>. Mitered
joints are the easiest to
make, for the joints can be cut
in a miter-box, Fig. 181, <a class="index" href="#page103">p. 103</a>, and glued in a picture-frame-vise,
Fig. 172, <a class="index" href="#page101">p. 101</a>. This joint needs reinforcement by nails, Fig. 268,
No. <a class="index1" href="#d52">52</a>, by dowels, No. <a class="index1" href="#d53">53</a>, or by splines, No. <a class="index1" href="#d55">55</a>. If the sides are of
different widths, the fitting of the joint is more difficult. Mitered
joints are the only kind suitable for molded frames. The rabbets
are cut out with a rabbeting-plane before mitering and assembling.</p>

<p>The principle disadvantage of a mitered joint is that, if the wood
shrinks at all, it opens at the
inside corners, as in Fig. 289,
because wood shrinks sidewise
but not lengthwise.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/289-260.png" width="260" height="232" alt="Fig. 289. The Way a Mitered Joint Opens on Account of Shrinkage." /><br /><br />Fig. 289. The Way a Mitered Joint Opens on Account of Shrinkage.</div>

<p>In window sashes, the dovetail
joint, Fig. 267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d47">47</a>, is
the common one at the upper
end of the lower sash and the
lower end of the upper sash,
and the mortise-and-tenon joint
modified is used at the lower
end of the lower and upper end
of the upper sash. The glass
takes the place of the panel.
In blind sashes, the pinned
mortise-and-tenon joint, Fig.
267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d38">38</a>, is commonly used.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[page&nbsp;195]</span>

<p>When panels are joined together to enclose a space, then we have
what is properly called cabinet construction. Illustrations are cabinets,
bureaus, desks, lockers, chests, etc.</p>

<p>In all these cases, the constructed panels may be treated as separate
boards and joined together with dowel pins or splines or dadoed
together without any other framework, tho the corners are often reinforced
by cleats or blocks glued into
them. Sometimes, however, as in
chests, Fig. 290, posts are used instead
of stiles, and rails are mortised or doweled
into them and the panels set into
grooves in both posts and rails. In this
case the bottom is raised from the floor,
and may be dadoed into the bottom
rails, or dowelled into them or even
supported by strips attached along their
lower inside edges. The chest really is a union of both paneled and
framed structures.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/290-450.png" width="450" height="425" alt="Fig. 290. Chest Construction." /><br /><br />Fig. 290. Chest Construction.</div>


<h4>(4) FRAMED STRUCTURES</h4>

<p>The principle of the framed structure is similar to that of the
panel construction in that the object is to allow for shrinkage without
harm to construction and also to economize materials. Common
examples are tables, chairs, work-benches, and frame houses.</p>

<p><i>The Making of a Table.</i> The standard height of a table is 30".
There should be 25" clearance under the rails. This leaves approximately
4" for the width of the rails. Assuming that the table is to
be of a simple straight line type with one drawer, the following
method of procedure is suggested:</p>

<p>Cut the boards for the top to the approximate length and stick,
(see <a class="index" href="#page48">p. 48</a>) and clamp them, so as to season them as well as possible
before jointing.</p>

<p>Dress to size the legs and rails. Stand the legs in their proper
positions relative to each other, and mark them F R (front right),
F L (front left), B R (back right), and B L (back left). Plow
out the grooves on the inside of the rails for the fastenings of the
top, Fig. 297, D, if they are to be used. Lay out and cut the tenons
and mortises for the end rails and back rail.</p>

<p>The proper form of the tenon is one with a wide shoulder above
it so that the top of the leg above the mortise will not shear out. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[page&nbsp;196]</span>
rails should be set near the outside of the leg so that the tenon may
be as long as possible and the portion of the leg inside it as strong
as possible. A haunched mortise-and-tenon joint, Fig. 267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d43">43</a>
is sometimes used, giving additional lateral stiffness to the rail. The
proper proportions are shown in Fig.
291. When cut, these parts should be
temporarily assembled to see if they fit.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/291-200.png" width="200" height="445" alt="Fig. 291. A. Cross-Section Thru Back Left Leg and Adjoining Rails of Table. (Plan). B. Elevation, Showing Wide Shoulder on Tenon of Rail." /><br /><br />Fig. 291. A. Cross-Section Thru Back Left Leg and Adjoining Rails of Table. (Plan). <br />B. Elevation, Showing Wide Shoulder on Tenon of Rail.</div>


<p>Inasmuch as a drawer takes the
place of a front rail, the front legs must
be tied together in some other way. For
this purpose two stringers or drawer
rails may be used, their front edges being
as far from the face of the legs as
are the rails from the side and back.
The upper drawer rail may be dovetailed
at both ends into the tops of the
legs, as shown in Fig. 292. If this
takes more room than can well be
spared from the depth of the drawer, it may be omitted, but it adds
greatly to the stiffness of the table and is an excellent means of
fastening on the top by the use of screws passing thru it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/292-460.png" width="460" height="450" alt="Fig. 292. Table Construction: Upper Drawer Rail of Table Dovetailed into Left Front Leg." /><br /><br />Fig. 292. Table Construction: Upper Drawer Rail of Table Dovetailed into Left Front Leg.</div>


<p>The drawer rail, also called the fore edge, is long enough to partly
overlap the side rails, into the lower edges of which it is gained so
as to be flush with them, and may be fastened to them with screws,
Fig. 293. The construction may be further strengthened by also
doweling the end of this stretcher into the legs. If there are two
drawers, the partition between them may be doweled or gained into
these upper and lower stretchers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/293-385.png" width="385" height="455" alt="Fig. 293. The Fixing of a Drawer Rail, Seen From Below." /><br /><br />Fig. 293. The Fixing of a Drawer Rail, Seen From Below.</div>

<p>If the legs are to be tapered or otherwise shaped, that should be
done next. Then glue and assemble the end rails with their proper
legs, taking care to see not only that the joints come up square, but
that the legs are in the same plane. Finally assemble the whole, inserting,
if necessary, a temporary diagonal brace to insure squareness,

<p>To fit the drawer to its place, runners and guides, Fig. 295, must
first be fastened in. The runners are in line with the drawer rail,
and are glued and nailed or screwed to the side rails between the
back of the lower stringer and the back posts. On top of them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[page&nbsp;197]</span>
in line with the inner face of the legs are the guides running between
the front and back posts. Or the runner and guide may be made of
one piece properly rabbeted out.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/295-385.png" width="385" height="447" alt="Fig. 295. Drawer Mechanism." /><br /><br />Fig. 295. Drawer Mechanism.</div>

<p>If there are two drawers, a double runner lies between, and is
gained into the middles of the
back rail and the stringer, and
on it is a guide for both drawers,
equal in width to the partition
between the drawers. The
drawers should run easily in
their proper places. In order
to insure this, the drawer
should be slightly narrower than the opening which receives it. A
little French chalk, rubbed on the sides and runners, makes the running
smoother. Sometimes the opening for a drawer is cut out of
the front rail, as in Fig. 296. In this case the drawer runners are
supported between the front and back rails, into which they may
be gained.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/296-700.png"><img src="images/296-500.png" width="500" height="182" alt="Fig. 296. Opening for Drawer Cut Out of Front Rail of Table." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 296. Opening for Drawer Cut Out of Front Rail of Table.</div>

<p>For the making of the table top see edge-to-edge joint, <a class="index" href="#page172">p. 172</a>.
Dress up the top to size, taking special pains with the upper surface.
If the grain is crossed, use the veneer-scraper, Fig. 151, <a class="index" href="#page92">p. 92</a>, then
sand, first with No. 1, then with No. 00 sandpaper, finish the edges
carefully, and attach to the frame.</p>

<p>For fastening the top to the table rails, several methods are used.
The top may be screwed to the rails by the screws passing thru the
rails themselves either straight up, Fig. 297, A, or diagonally from
the inside, B, or thru blocks or angle irons, C, which are screwed
to the inside of the rails, or thru buttons, or panel irons, D, which
are free to move in a groove cut near the top of the rail. The last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[page&nbsp;198]</span>
method is the best because it allows for the inevitable shrinkage and
swelling of the top.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/297-1000.png"><img src="images/297-600.png" width="600" height="183" alt="Fig. 297. Methods of attaching Table Top to Rails." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 297. Methods of attaching Table Top to Rails.</div>

<p><i>Chairs</i> may be so simplified in form as to be possible for the amateur
to construct. The two front legs and the rail and stretcher between
them offer little difficulty because the angles are square.</p>

<p>The two back legs, may, for the purpose of simplification, be kept
parallel to each other and at right angles to the seat rails between
them, as in Fig. 298, A, and not at an angle as in B. The joining
of the back will then offer little difficulty. The principal difficulties
lie in the facts that for comfort and appearance the back of the chair
should incline backward both above and below the seat, and that the
back of the seat should be narrower than the front. By keeping at
right angles to the floor the part of the back legs which receives the
seat rail, the side seat rails will meet the back legs at a right angle
in a side view, Fig. 298. The back legs should be slightly shorter
than the front legs, as shown in D.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/298-600.png" width="600" height="445" alt="Fig. 298. Chair Construction." /><br /><br />Fig. 298. Chair Construction.</div>

<p>The second difficulty involves the making of inclined mortise-and-tenon
joints, A, where the side rails fit into the legs. The making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[page&nbsp;199]</span>
of these can be facilitated by
laying out a plan of the full
size and taking the desired angles
directly from that. It is
common to reinforce these
joints with corner blocks glued
and screwed in place as shown
in A. If there are additional
rails below the seat rails, the
easiest way to fit them in
place is first to fit and clamp
together the chair with the seat rails only, taking pains to have all
angles perfectly true, and then to take the exact measurements for
the lower rails directly from the chair. The same method may be
used for laying out a stringer between the lower rails.</p>

<p>If it is desired to bow the rails of the back, which are above the
seat rail, this can be done by boiling them in water for 30 minutes
and then clamping them over a form of the proper shape, with a
piece of stiff sheet iron on the outside, as in Fig. 299. They should
be thoroly dried in a warm place. Then the tenons may be laid out
on the ends parallel to a straight-edge laid along the concave side.
The chair bottom may be made of solid wood, either flat or modeled
into a "saddle seat;" it may be covered with cane or rush, or it may
be upholstered.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/299-500.png" width="500" height="330" alt="Fig. 299. Bending Boards into Shape after Boiling Them." /><br /><br />Fig. 299. Bending Boards into Shape after Boiling Them.</div>

<p>To upholster a chair seat, a frame should first be made of the
shape shown in Fig. 298, C.
The strips are
about 2" wide and &frac12;"
thick with their ends
half-lapped. The seat
rails are rabbeted &frac12;"
deep and &frac12;" wide to
receive this frame,
which should be &#8539;"
smaller all around than
the place to receive it.
The returns at the corners
fit around the legs at &#8539;" distance from them. This &#8539;" provides
space for the coverings. After the frame is fitted, it is covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[page&nbsp;200]</span>
with 3" webbing tacked firmly to the upper side. The webbing which
goes back and forth is interwoven with that which goes from right
to left. Over this is stretched and tacked (also to the upper side) a
piece of unbleached muslin. A second piece of muslin is tacked to
the back edge and part way along the side edges, leaving for the
time the corners unfinished. In the pocket thus formed horsehair or
other stuffing is pushed, care being taken to distribute it evenly and
not too thick. When the pocket is filled, the muslin is tacked farther
along the sides and more hair put in, until the front is reached, when
the muslin is tacked to the front edge. The corners are now drawn
in tight, a careful snip with the scissors parting them diagonally so
as to lie in well. The partings may be turned down and tacked on
the under side of the frame.</p>

<p>Finally the leather or other covering is stretched over the whole
as evenly as possible. The corners should be left to the last, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[page&nbsp;201]</span>
clipped diagonally to the exact inside corner and the partings drawn
down and tacked, as was the muslin. The superfluous leather may
then be trimmed off, and the seat should fit in its place. Or the seat
frame may be omitted, and the coverings tacked directly to the chair
rails.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/300-1000.png"><img src="images/300-500.png" width="500" height="446" alt="Fig. 300. House Construction." /></a><br /><br />Fig. 300. House Construction.</div>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">The balloon-frame house is a typical form of framed construction,
Fig. 300. The essential parts of a balloon-frame are:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>1. SILL, 4"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;8", which rests on the foundation.</li>

<li>2. BEAMS, 4"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;8", which rest on the cellar posts, 6"&times;6". (Not shown

<li>3. FLOOR JOISTS, 2"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;8", which rest on the sill and beams.</li>

<li>4. CORNER POSTS, 4"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;6", with 2"&times;4" studs nailed to them.</li>

<li>5. STUDDING, 2"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;4", which stand 16" between centers.</li>

<li>6. WALL RIBBON, or girt, 1"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;8", which supports the upper story joists.</li>

<li>7. PLATES, two 2"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;4" nailed together, resting on studs.</li>

<li>8. RAFTERS, 2"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;6", which support the roof.</li>

<li>9. TIE-BEAMS, 2"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;6", which prevent the roof from spreading the walls.

<li>10. RIDGE-POLE, 2"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;8", against which the rafters butt.</li>

<li>11. BRIDGING, 2"&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;2", which stiffens the floor joists.</li>

<li>12. SHEATHING, (1" thick), put on diagonally to brace the building.
The rest is covering.</li>

<li>13. FLOORING, (See also Fig. 301.)

<ul class="index1">
<li>In flooring, Fig. 301, the boards are made narrow so as to reduce the
size of openings at the joints when they shrink, and also to reduce the
tendency to warp. They may be laid side by side as in the cheapest floors,

<h3>PRINCIPLES OF JOINERY.<sup>11</sup></h3>

<p class="note1">Footnote 11: Professor Rankine's Five Principles:</p>

<p class="note1">1. To cut the joints and arrange the fastenings so as to weaken the
pieces of timber they connect as little as possible.</p>

<p class="note1">2. To place each abutting surface in a joint as nearly as possible perpendicular
to the pressure which it has to transmit.</p>

<p class="note1">3. To proportion the area of each surface to the pressure which it has
to bear so that the timber may be safe against injury under the heaviest
load which occurs in practice, and to form and fit every pair of such surfaces
accurately in order to distribute the stress uniformly.</p>

<p class="note1">4. To proportion the fastenings so that they may be of equal strength
with the pieces which they connect.</p>

<p class="note1">5. To place the fastenings in each piece of timber so that there shall be
sufficient resistance to the giving way of the joint by the fastenings shearing
or crushing their way thru the timber.</p>


<p class="ind" style="margin-top: 2em;">1. <i>Avoid multiplication of errors by making all measurements (as
far as possible) from a common starting point, and laying off all
angles from the same line or surface.</i> Illustrations of this principle
are as follows: Before proceeding with other processes, a working
face and working edge and as many other surfaces as will finally appear
in the finished piece, should be trued up. At least the working
face and working edge are essential to the proper "lay-out" of the
piece, whenever measurements are made from an edge.</p>

<p>In laying out a series of measurements, it is important, when possible,
that the rule be laid down once for all, and the additions be
made on that, rather than that the rule should be moved along for
each new member of the series.</p>

<p>In scoring around a board with knife and try-square, the head of
the try-square should be held against the working face in scoring
both edges, and against the working edge in scoring both faces, and
not passed from one surface to another in succession.</p>

<p>In the laying out of a halved joint, Fig. 265, Nos. <a class="index1" href="#d15">15</a>-19, <a class="index" href="#page178">p. 178</a>,
the gaging is all done from what will be one of the flush surfaces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[page&nbsp;204]</span>
the joined pieces. Then, if the gaged line should be slightly more or
less than half the thickness of the pieces the closeness of the joint
would not be affected.</p>

<p class="ind">2. <i>When possible, in laying out a joint, use the method of superposition.</i>
Fig. 302. By this is meant the method by which the lay-out
of one member is obtained directly
from the other by laying
(superposing) the latter
on the former and marking or
scribing the needed dimensions
directly, instead of by
measurement. It has the advantages
of simplicity, speed,
and greater probability of fit.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/302-535.png" width="535" height="450" alt="Fig. 302. Marking by Superposition." /><br /><br />Fig. 302. Marking by Superposition.</div>

<p>Familiar illustrations are
in the making of halved joints,
Fig. 265, Nos. <a class="index1" href="#d15">15</a>-19, <a class="index" href="#page178">p. 178</a>,
dovetail joints, Fig. 267, Nos.
<a class="index1" href="#d42">42</a>-45. <a class="index" href="#page180">p. 180</a>, and scarfed or
spliced joints, Fig. 264, Nos. <a class="index1" href="#d4">4</a>-7. <a class="index" href="#page177">p. 177</a>.</p>

<p class="ind">3. <i>Work systematically.</i> In case the same process is to be repeated
on a number of parts, complete this process in all before
taking up another process. This is the principle of the division of
labor applied to the individual workman.</p>

<p>In laying out duplicate or multiple parts, the proper cross measurements
should be carefully laid out on one piece and then
transferred with a try-square to the other parts laid accurately beside
it. So when a number of like pieces are to be gaged, all the
parts requiring the same setting should be gaged before the gage is
reset for another gaging. This is a great saving of time and insures
accuracy.</p>

<p>In making a number of like parts, if they are not too large much
of the work can often be done in one piece before it is cut up. For
example, to make a number of slats from a given piece of wood, the
piece may first be brought to such dimensions that the length will be
correct for the finished pieces and the thickness of the piece be equal
to the width of the slats, Fig. 303. The face may then be gaged with
a series of lines so that every other space will be equal to the required
thickness of each slat, and the alternate spaces be just sufficient for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[page&nbsp;205]</span>
the saw kerf and dressing. The slats may then be ripped apart and
dressed to size.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/303-500.png" width="500" height="326" alt="Fig. 303. Making a Number of Like Pieces from a Given Piece." /><br /><br />Fig. 303. Making a Number of Like Pieces from a Given Piece.</div>

<p>Or a long strip may be planed to thickness and width and then
be sawn up and finished to the proper lengths. For example, in a
mitered picture-frame it may be convenient to plane up two pieces,
each one long enough to make one long
side and one short side.</p>

<p>In fitting up framed structures each
part when fitted should be distinctly
marked, so that there may be no confusion
in assembling.</p>

<p class="ind">4. <i>Where practicable secure the
same conditions of grain in different
elements of joined structures.</i></p>

<p>Illustrations of this are as follows: The grain of the sides of a
box should run continuously around the box, or, in the case of a tall,
slim box, the grain of all the sides should run up and down. In
either case, the grain in the different sides is parallel. In a rubbed
joint, Fig. 269, No. <a class="index1" href="#d70">70</a>, <a class="index" href="#page182">p. 182</a>, to be planed down afterward, in case
the grain is not straight, much trouble in planing may be saved if
the different pieces are laid so that they can all be planed smooth in
the same direction. This may not be possible where the boards are
joined so as to match the grain, as in quartered oak, or where the
annual rings of slash boards are made to alternate in direction so as
to lessen warping, Fig. 280, <a class="index" href="#page186">p. 186</a>.</p>

<p class="ind">5. <i>Where possible, allow for shrinkage without prejudice to construction.</i></p>

<p>The most obvious illustration of this principle is panel construction.
In a panel, the frame, which is comparatively narrow, follows
the principal dimensions, and hence does not seriously shrink or
swell itself. But the panel, which is grooved into the frame can
shrink or swell without harm to the general structure.</p>

<p>In a gained joint, as in a case of shelves, Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d29">29</a>, <a class="index" href="#page179">p. 179</a>,
the gain in the uprights does not extend quite to the front of the
shelves, and there is a corresponding slight shoulder at the front end
of the shelf, so that if the shelf and support shrink unevenly, no gap
will be apparent.</p>

<p>A drawing-board, Fig. 280, <a class="index" href="#page186">p. 186</a>, is so made that it can shrink
or swell without losing its flatness. Shingles when properly laid, can
shrink or swell without the roof leaking.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[page&nbsp;206]</span>

<p class="ind">6. <i>Where feasible, undercut joined surfaces so as to give clearance
on the inside and insure a tight appearance. But glued surfaces
should be made to meet flat.</i></p>

<p>Illustrations of this principle are as follows: The inner end of
the socket in a dovetail joint, Fig. 267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d48">48</a>, <a class="index" href="#page180">p. 180</a>, may be undercut
slightly so as to insure the pin's falling close into place.</p>

<p>The shoulder of any tenon may be undercut so as to allow the
edges of the tenoned piece to close up tight against the mortised piece.</p>

<p>In an end-lap halved joint, Fig. 265, No. <a class="index1" href="#d17">17</a>, <a class="index" href="#page178">p. 178</a>, the edges
should meet all around; if they are to be glued together, they should
<i>not</i> be undercut or they will not glue well.</p>

<p>In matched flooring, the underside of the boards is slightly narrower
than the upper side so that the joint may close on the upper
side without fail, Fig. 301, <a class="index" href="#page201">p. 201</a>. The ends of flooring boards are
also slightly beveled so as to make a tight fit on the upper side.</p>

<p class="ind">7. <i>Select the simplest form of joint and use the smallest number
of abutments (bearing surfaces) possible, because the more complicated
the joint or the greater the number of bearing surfaces, the less
likelihood there is of a sound and inexpensive construction.</i></p>

<p>Illustrations of this principle are as follows: Usually a single
mortise-and-tenon joint is better than a double one because of simplicity,
strength and ease of making. Where much surface is required
for gluing, a double one may be better.</p>

<p>In a dovetail dado, Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d28">28</a>, <a class="index" href="#page179">p. 179</a>, it is usually sufficient
to make the dovetail on one side only.</p>

<p>Many very elaborately spliced joints have been devised, which
have no practical advantage over the simple ones, Fig. 264, Nos. <a class="index1" href="#d4">4</a>-7,
<a class="index" href="#page177">p. 177</a>.</p>

<p>A butt joint, Fig. 264, No. <a class="index1" href="#d11">11</a>, is stronger than a mitered joint,
Fig. 268, No. <a class="index1" href="#d52">52</a>, in a box, for the latter is almost sure to shrink
apart. Where appearance is important, a ledge and miter joint has
the advantage of both, Fig. 268, No. <a class="index1" href="#d58">58</a>.</p>

<p class="ind">8. <i>Keep a due proportion of strength between the fastenings
(joints) and the pieces fastened: i.&nbsp;e., the construction should neither
be frail on the one hand, because the pieces of wood are weakened by
too much cutting, nor clumsy, on the other hand, because then the
fastenings would be inordinately strong. In other words, the different
parts should be equally strong.</i></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[page&nbsp;207]</span>

<p>Illustrations of this principle are as follows: In a fished joint,
Fig. 264, No. <a class="index1" href="#d2">2</a>, the plate should be attached so as to reinforce the
splice at the weakest point.</p>

<p>In a scarf joint, Fig. 264, Nos. <a class="index1" href="#d5">5</a> and <a class="index1" href="#d7">7</a>, the angle should be
oblique enough to give the greatest leverage.</p>

<p>In a tusk tenon, Fig. 267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d40">40</a>, the tenon is made but one-sixth
the thickness of the timber, whereas the tusk is made much
larger.</p>

<p>Where a mortise is to be cut in a timber bearing weight, it
should be cut in the neutral axis, where the cutting of fibres will
weaken it least.</p>

<p>In the mortise-and-tenon of a table-rail, Fig. 267, No. <a class="index1" href="#d43">43</a>, there
should be a wide shoulder above the tenon of the rail so that the
top of the leg above the mortise will not shear out. The mortise
should be as near the outside of the leg as possible so that the inner
corner of the leg may remain strong. The tenon should be strong
enough to share the strain with the shoulders.</p>

<p>A dado joint, Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d25">25</a>, should not be so deep as to
weaken the supporting board.</p>

<p>A tenon should not be so large as to weaken the mortised piece.</p>

<p>Pins or other fastenings, Fig. 267, Nos. <a class="index1" href="#d38">38</a> and <a class="index1" href="#d39">39</a>, may weaken
rather than strengthen a joint if they are so placed or are so large
as to shear or crush their way thru the timber.</p>

<p class="ind">9. <i>Place each abutting surface in a joint as nearly as possible perpendicular
to the pressure which it has to transmit.</i></p>

<p>Illustrations of this principle are as follows: the angle in a strut
joint, Fig. 266, No. <a class="index1" href="#d62">62</a>, should be equally divided between the two
beams.</p>

<p>The thrust joint, Fig. 268, No. <a class="index1" href="#d63">63</a>, in a bridge truss, is exactly
at right angles to the pressure.</p>

<p>It is on account of this principle that a spliced joint for compression,
Fig. 264, No. <a class="index1" href="#d4">4</a>, is different from a spliced joint for tension,
No. <a class="index1" href="#d5">5</a>; and that a housed braced joint, Fig. 269, No. <a class="index1" href="#d66">66</a>, is
better than a plain braced joint, No. <a class="index1" href="#d65">65</a>.</p>

<p>A joint to resist vertical cross strain is stronger when scarfed vertically
than horizontally.</p>

<h3>WOOD FINISHING.</h3>

<h4>STAINS.</h4>

<p>The function of stains is to change the color, and to enchance
the grain and texture of the wood. Stains may be divided into
four general classes, which are not, however, entirely distinct.
(1) Oil stains, (2) Water stains, (a) made from anilines, (b) made
from dyes other than anilines, (3) Spirit stains, (4) Stains due to
chemical changes.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Oil stains.</i> Advantages: they are easily prepared, are easy to
apply evenly, and they do not raise the grain. Disadvantages: they
cover the grain somewhat, are apt to give a muddy effect, they do not
penetrate very deeply into the wood, and it is impossible to stain
hard wood dark with them and at the same time keep the grain and
texture of the wood clear. A convenient form in which to handle
these pigments is Devoe's "coach colors," ground in japan. To prevent
evaporation from cans once opened, it is well to keep them partly
filled with water and the water covered with a little oil. For use, the
pigments are thinned with turpentine or benzine, in the proportion of
one pound of color to one-half gallon of turpentine or benzine. Benzine
is much cheaper than turpentine, but evaporates more quickly.
The addition of a little boiled oil gives a body to the stain, so that
when the wood is well rubbed down a soft lustre can be had without
any further finish. The stain should be applied with a brush to the
wood, which may then be rubbed clean with cotton waste. Oil stains
penetrate hard woods better when the wood has first been fumed in
ammonia. (See below, p. 211). Or, the addition of a little ammonia
to the stain just before applying aids it in penetrating the wood.</p>

<p>The pigments most used for oil stains are: burnt and raw umber,
burnt and raw sienna, Vandyke brown, drop black, and medium
chrome yellow. These colors may be varied by mixing. For example,
for a green stain, take two parts of drop black and one part
of medium chrome yellow, and dissolve in turpentine or benzine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[page&nbsp;210]</span>
The addition of a little vermilion gives a grayer green. The green
may be made bluer by the addition of Prussian blue, but the blue already
contained in the black gives a soft, pleasant green.</p>

<p>For antique oak, add a trifle of burnt umber and black to raw
sienna thinned to the right consistency.</p>

<p>For a reddish brown, thin burnt umber to the right consistency.
This may be grayed by the addition of a little green.</p>

<p>A walnut stain may be had by adding a little Venetian red to
asphaltum, thinned with turpentine or benzine.</p>

<p><i>Aniline oil stains.</i> Advantages: the colors are clear and easily
obtainable. Disadvantages: the colors are likely to be crude and too
bright, and unless great care is taken the tones are metallic and not
soft enough to suit wood. It is necessary to purchase colors soluble
in oil. These can be had of William Zinnser and Company, 197
William Street, New York. Four colors are necessary to get the desired
shades, Bismarck brown, dark yellow, dark blue, and black. Bismarck
brown comes in powdered form at $2.40 per lb., dark yellow
comes in powdered form at $2.40 per lb., dark blue comes in lumps
at $3.20 per lb., black comes in lumps at $2.40 per lb. These may
be dissolved in three ounces of turpentine to one ounce of boiled oil,
to one teaspoonful of color, a process that will take place much faster
if the mixture is heated. Great care must be taken, however, not
to set fire to the turpentine. When cool, thin with turpentine to the
proper consistency, apply to the wood with a brush and rub clean
with cotton waste.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Water Stains.</i> Advantages: they are cheap and clear and
do not obscure the grain as oil stains are likely to do, and they penetrate
deeply into the wood, especially when applied hot. They may be
made of any coloring matter that is soluble in water, and are particularly
good for hard woods and for use in large quantities. It is
possible to stain wood much darker with them than with oil stains.
Moreover, the brushes used with them are easily taken care of. Disadvantages:
they are difficult to prepare and they raise the grain of
the wood. The former disadvantage may be overcome by buying
them all prepared.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the raising of the grain is to be obviated either
by washing the wood in water and, when dry, rubbing down with
sandpaper before applying the stain, or rubbing down after staining
and re-staining when necessary.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[page&nbsp;211]</span>

<p>a. Water stains made from anilines. Aniline stains are likely
to fade, but the addition of a little vinegar is said to hinder fading.
For Mahogany, dissolve 1 oz. Bismarck brown in 3 quarts of boiling
water. Use when cool.</p>

<p>b. Water stains made from dyes other than anilines. The number
of these is legion; some of the simpler are given.</p>

<p>Reddish Brown. Dissolve extract of logwood of the size of a walnut
in &frac12; cup (4 oz.) of hot water. Apply hot to wood repeatedly
until desired color is obtained.</p>

<p>Black. Dissolve extract of logwood of the size of a walnut
in &frac12; cup (4 oz.) of boiling water. Add a teaspoonful of alum.
Apply repeatedly until the wood is dark brown. Prepare acetate
of iron according to directions for making dark brown, on next page.
Apply this to wood already browned with logwood. If the grain
is raised, sandpaper lightly, or rub with steel wool and then with
boiled oil.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Spirit Stains.</i> These are expensive and hence little used. A
few illustrations are given.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 12: For detailed directions for treatment of different woods, see
Hodgson, pp. 112-153.</p>

<p>Black. Aniline black, cut in alcohol, gives a bluish effect but if
the wood thus stained is rubbed with raw linseed oil, it becomes black.</p>

<p>Another Black. Dissolve extract of logwood in wood alcohol. Develop
the color by going over the work with tincture of muriate of iron.</p>

<p>Golden Oak. Dissolve asphaltum in naphtha until it is as thin
as water and makes a yellowish stain; or to equal parts of asphaltum,
varnish, and gold size japan, add enough turpentine to thin to proper
consistency.</p>

<p>Mahogany. Dissolve Bismarck Brown in alcohol.</p>

<p>Aniline stains may be cut in alcohol and mixed with equal parts
of white shellac and banana oil (amyl acetate) and all applied in
one coat.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Stains due to chemical changes</i>. Certain substances like ammonia,
potassium bichromate, and acetate of iron, give chemical reactions
on certain woods and make very effective and inexpensive
stains. Moreover the artistic effect of some of them is unexcelled.
When applied in solution they are likely to raise the grain.</p>

<p>The effect of ammonia, either the liquid or fumes, is much the
same as the effect produced by aging or weathering. Ammonia also
cuts the pith rays of oak and makes it possible for other stains to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[page&nbsp;212]</span>
take hold. For this reason it is much used as a preliminary treatment
for oak finishes. The color effect is to lessen the yellow and
increase the gray.</p>

<p>The method of application is simply to expose the wood for a
day or more to the fumes of strong ammonia (28%) in a tightly
closed box. If the surface of the wood is moistened with water just
before exposure, it turns darker than if exposed dry. The stain
penetrates so deeply that it may be sandpapered after the exposure
without harm. After fuming and sandpapering the surface should
be oiled to prevent finger marks.</p>

<p>Dark brown for chestnut, or oak, or mahogany. This is obtained
with a solution of acetate of iron, made as follows: digest one part
by measure of iron dust in 8 parts of glacial acetic acid. After the
chemical action is well started, add several times as much water
to keep the mixture liquid. When the chemical action has ceased, the
stain is ready for use. If a lighter shade is desired it may be still
further diluted.</p>

<p>To darken mahogany. Make a saturate solution of bichromate of
potash. Dilute a portion of it with water <span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&frasl;</span><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">2</span>,
or <span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&frasl;</span><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">3</span>,
or <span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&frasl;</span><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">4</span>, or in any
proportion according to the darkness required. One part of the solution
to two or three parts of water gives a good color. Apply the
solution to mahogany with a brush. This solution alone is likely to
be too brown. The reddish tinge of the wood may be saved by mixing
as follows:</p>

<p>Bichromate of potash on oak gives a rich brown.</p>

<p>Bichromate of potash on ash gives a rich red.</p>

<p>Bichromate of potash on black walnut gives a dark brown.</p>

<p>A decoction of logwood treated with tannin gives yellow red,
with sugar of lead gives gray brown, with ferric nitrate gives black.
A decoction of fustic extract treated with dilute nitric acid gives
brown, etc.<sup>13</sup></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[page&nbsp;213]</span>

<p><i>Commercial Stains.</i> Some of the more noteworthy commercial
stains, suitable for school use, are those of:</p>

<p>The Bridgeport Wood Finishing Company, 55 Fulton St., New
York. Among their water stains some of the best are: Flemish oak,
weathered oak, walnut, silver gray, forest green, and mahogany, especially
if the latter is modified with bichromate of potash. Other
effects may be obtained by mixing these, as forest green, which is too
bright alone, mixed with walnut or some other reddish color gives
a grayish green. Of the penetrating oil stains the golden oak and
mahogany are very good.</p>

<p>The Sherwin Williams Company, of Cleveland, Newark, Chicago,
etc., produce a fine line of spirit stains.</p>

<p>The Adams and Elting Company, Chicago, have a stain called
adelite, in which banana oil appears to be the solvent. It is very
easy of application, only one coat being needed. It is applied with
the brush.</p>

<p>Berry Brothers, of Detroit, Mich., the famous varnish makers,
furnish a great variety of colors in their water stains and also a combined
stain and finish under the trade name of Lacklustre.</p>

<p>Devoe and Reynolds, 101 Fulton Street, New York, make a variety
of oil stains which can be applied either in one coat with a brush
or rubbed in with cotton waste.</p>

<p>The Chicago Varnish Company, make a specialty of artistic, chemical
stains, but unfortunately they are not yet (1910) available in
small quantities.</p>

<p>S. C. Johnson and Son, Racine, Wis., furnish a variety of spirit
stains called "wood dyes."</p>

<p>The Craftsman Workshops, Eastwood, N. Y., furnish oil stains to
be applied with a brush or waste. These are deservedly famous for
they give especially soft, agreeable effects on fumed oak.</p>

<p>In general, it should be remembered that oil stains are better for
soft woods, water stains for hard woods, and the spirit stains are good
for both. But without a sense of color, no number of recipes will
avail.</p>


<h4>FILLING</h4>

<p>The object of filling is to give a perfectly level and non-absorbent
basis for varnish covering or other finish. This can be done with
shellac carefully rubbed down with fine oiled sandpaper, but this
method requires much toil and patience, and has therefore been given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[page&nbsp;214]</span>
up by furniture finishers. The best fillers, (such as "Wheeler's Wood
filler"),<sup>14</sup> are made of silex in needle-shaped particles mixed with
raw linseed oil, japan and turpentine. When applied to wood it
should be thinned with turpentine or benzine, and applied with a
brush along the grain. As it dries, the color becomes grayish and it
should then be rubbed off across the grain with fine shavings or cotton
waste. It is best to have fillers of several colors on hand, such
as light, black, mahogany, and "golden oak" to be used according
to the stain applied. The filler should be applied after staining the
wood and should be allowed to dry thoroly, say forty-eight hours, before
it is covered with shellac or varnish. Its use is more necessary
on open grained woods, like oak, chestnut, and mahogany, than on
close grained woods, like whitewood, maple, and pine, but it is best
to use it on all woods that are to be highly polished.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 14: Made by the Bridgeport Wood Finishing Co., 155 Fulton St., N. Y.</p>

<p>Cans should be kept tightly covered when not in use. Since oil
darkens wood, if wood is to be kept light, a filler without oil, as whiting
and turpentine, should be used.</p>


<h4>POLISHES</h4>

<p>There are three principal forms of wood polishes, each of which
has its virtues and defects. They are: (a) oil, (b) wax, (c) the
varnishes.</p>

<p>(a) <i>Oil.</i> The great advantage of oil polishing is its permanence.
It will stand both wetting and warmth and gives a dull, glossy
finish. In some woods, as sweet gum and mahogany, it brings up the
figure.</p>

<p>Process. Apply either raw or boiled linseed oil diluted with five
parts of benzine or turpentine. The advantages of dilution are that
the mixture penetrates the wood better, leaves a thinner film on the
surface and is more economical. Then rub, rub, rub, day after day.
Little and often with unlimited friction, is the best rule. This makes
a nice finish for well-fumed chestnut, turning the color to a rich
brown.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Wax.</i> Wax is an old English polish, commonly used before
French polish and varnish were introduced, especially for hard woods
like oak. Its advantages are that it is cheap, easily prepared, easily
applied, and easily repaired. Its disadvantages are that it will not
stand wetting, is easily marred, requires constant care, is not so hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[page&nbsp;215]</span>
and dry as varnish, turns slightly sticky with warmth, and is likely to
turn white in crevices.</p>

<p>To prepare it. To one part of melted beeswax add one part of turpentine.
Mix and cool. It can be bought prepared, as, Bridgeport
Wood Finishing Company's "Old Dutch Finish," Butcher's Wax,
Johnson's Wax, and others.</p>

<p>Process. Rub the wax evenly over the surface with a stiff brush
or the fingers. Let it dry for some hours, and then rub with a cloth:
flannel or a piece of felt is best. Put on several coats, leaving the
work over night between coats. Rub often with a warm cloth.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Varnishes.</i> The function of varnishes is to cover wood with
a hard, transparent coating that is non-porous and impervious to
moisture. There is a great range among them, from thin, easily worn,
dull finishes to durable, strong, and highly polished coatings called
"rubbing varnishes." The polished surface can be secured only by
much labor thru the application of successive thin coats of good varnish,
carefully rubbed down.</p>

<p>Varnish may be applied to wood, stained, painted, or in its natural
condition as well as to metal, leather, paper, and various other substances.
A good varnish should be adhesive, that is, it should cling
firmly to the surface to which it is applied; it should be elastic, so
as not to crack on account of the expansion and contraction of the
material to which it is applied; it should dry in a reasonable time;
it should be limpid so as to flow easily in application; it should be
transparent and brilliant when polished; and it should be durable.
The necessary conditions for all good varnishing are a perfectly
smooth, even, filled surface of dry wood, a temperature of about 70&deg;
and no dust in the air.</p>

<p>In general, there are two classes of varnish, based on the character
of the solvent, (1) Spirit varnishes and (2) Oil varnishes.</p>

<p>(1) Spirit varnishes are sometimes made with copal resins dissolved
in some spirit, as one of the alcohols, benzine, acetone, etc.
They dry with great rapidity owing to the volatilization of the solvent
spirit, leaving a coat of pure resin of great hardness and brilliance,
but one which is likely to crack and scale when exposed. They
are not much used. Shellac is the most common and the most useful
of the spirit varnishes. Its basis is resin lac, a compound resinous
substance exuded from an East India scale insect (<i>Carteria lacca</i>)
found mostly in the province of Assam. The term "lac" is the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[page&nbsp;216]</span>
as "lakh" which means 100,000 and is indicative of the countless
hosts of insects which are the source from which this gum is obtained.
The larval insects insert their proboscides into the bark of
young shoots of certain lac-bearing trees, varieties of Ficus, draw out
the sap for nutriment, and at once exude a resinous secretion which
entirely covers their bodies and the twigs, often to the thickness of
one-half inch. The females never escape and after impregnation their
ovaries become filled with a red fluid which forms a valuable dye
known as lac dye. The encrusted twigs are gathered by the natives
in the spring and again in the autumn, before the young are hatched,
and in this condition the product is known as "stick lac." After
being crushed and separated from the twigs and washed free from
the coloring matter the product is known as "seed lac." It is then
melted and strained and spread out in thin layers in a form called
"shell lac." This is what is known as orange shellac in the market.
It may be bleached by boiling in caustic potash, and passing chlorine
thru it until the resin is precipitated. It is further whitened by
being pulled. This is what is known in the market as "white shellac."
It comes in lumps. Orange shellac is the stronger and is less likely
to deteriorate, but white is easier to apply because it sets less rapidly.
Another advantage of the white is its colorlessness. Shellac is soluble
in both grain alcohol (ethyl alcohol) and wood alcohol (methyl
alcohol), but grain alcohol is preferable. Great care must be taken
not to mix even a drop of water in it or it will curdle. To make
perfect the process of ordinary filling, shellac may be used as a filler
either by itself or preparatory to other processes. Since it dries
quickly it can be rubbed down in six or eight hours either with No.
00 sandpaper oiled, or better, with No. 00 steel wool. This process
when repeated several times gives a good "egg-shell" finish. It may
be applied alone over stained wood or the shellac itself may be colored
with aniline dyes cut in alcohol. This, for example, is an easy way to
get a black finish.</p>

<p>A good waterproof wood polish is made thus: 1 pint alcohol,
2 oz. gum benzoin, &frac14; oz. gum sandarac, &frac14; oz. gum anime. Put in
a bottle, and put the bottle in a hot water bath until all solids are dissolved.
Strain and add &frac14; gill clear poppy oil. Shake well and apply
with cotton cloth.</p>

<p>A soft, dull, glossy finish may be obtained by applying two coats
of a mixture of one part each of white shellac and banana oil (amyl
acetate). When dry, sandpaper lightly and wax.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[page&nbsp;217]</span>

<p><i>French polishing.</i> The finest of shellac finishes is French polish.
It is a thin, clear, permanent finish, but the process takes time and
patience. It is not much used in practical work, because of the
time expense, but is often employed in school shops, because only a
few materials are necessary, it dries quickly, and gives a beautiful
finish. The polished surface is obtained by adding successive thin
coats according to the following process:</p>

<p>(1) Preparation. The surface of the wood must be perfectly
smooth and even, sandpapered in the direction of the grain, stained,
if desired, filled, rubbed smooth and quite dry. (2) Apply two or
three thin coats of shellac. After each coat when dry, rub with
No. 00 oiled sandpaper or No. 00 steel wool. Wipe thoroly. (3)
Make three pads, about the size of a walnut, of clean, white, cotton
waste, enclosed in some fine old or washed cloth with no sizing or
lint,&mdash;one pad for shellac, one for oil, and one for alcohol. Fill one
pad with shellac of the consistency of milk, enough in the pad so that
when squeezed hard it will ooze out. The common mistake is to put
too much shellac into the pad. Rub with circular motion, as indicated
in Fig. 304, never letting
the pad stop on the surface.
(4) Sprinkle a very little finely
powdered pumicestone and put
a little oil on the surface of the
wood here and there with the
tip of a finger. Rub with second
pad until surface is dull.
Wipe clean. Repeat (3) and
(4) several times. Some use
raw linseed oil to prevent sticking.
Others use three or four
cloth coverings on the shellac
pad, removing the outer one as
it dries. A simpler way is to keep the shellac in pad, 1, thin by
moistening with a little alcohol. (5) Spiriting off (Follows process
4.) Dampen pad, 3, with very little alcohol and wipe quickly in
the direction of the grain. This should remove the circular marks.
Too much alcohol in this third pad will "burn" a dull spot. The
rubbers are said to improve with use, and may be preserved in closely
stoppered jars to prevent evaporation. The different kinds of pads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[page&nbsp;218]</span>
should be kept separate. Or the cotton waste may be thrown away,
and the cloths washed in strong borax water. In the process just
described, shellac alone, dissolved in alcohol, is used. The shellac
may be used with other ingredients: for example, 1 pint grain alcohol,
&frac14; oz. gum copal, &frac14; oz. gum arabic, 1 oz. shellac. Strain
through muslin.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/304-500.png" width="500" height="421" alt="Fig. 304. Direction of the Pad in French Polishing." /><br /><br />Fig. 304. Direction of the Pad in French Polishing.</div>

<p>Another recipe for finishing. Use 4 drams grain alcohol, 2 drams
orange shellac, 5 drams tincture of benzoin, 1 teaspoonful of olive
oil. Dissolve and strain. Apply with pad in direction of grain.</p>

<p><i>Oil or Copal Varnishes.</i> The old Cremona varnish once used for
violins is supposed to have had amber (Greek, electron) as its base.
It was a fossilized coniferous resin found on the shore of the Baltic
Sea. The art of making it is said to be lost, probably because of
the difficulty and danger of melting it, for this can be done only in
oil on account of the danger of ignition. Hence its use has been
abandoned.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most beautiful of all varnishes is lacquer, much used
in China and Japan. It is made from the juice of the lacquer tree,
(<i>Rhus vernicifera</i>) which is tapped during the summer months. The
juice is strained and evaporated and then mixed with various substances,
such as oil, fine clay, body pigment, and metallic dust, according
to the ware for which it is intended. The manufacturing secrets
are carefully guarded. The application of it is very difficult, the sap
of young trees being used for first coats, and of old trees for the
finishing coats. It must be dried in a damp, close atmosphere. For
the best work ten or twelve coats are elaborately rubbed down and
polished. Even the presence of it is very poisonous to some people
and all workers in it are more or less affected.</p>

<p>The solvent or vehicle of the modern copal varnishes consists
principally of linseed oil with some turpentine. Their base is Copal,
a fossil, resinous substance of vegetable origin. The gums of which
they are made have been chemically altered by long exposure in the
earth. Other gums, as mastic, dammar, sandarac, and even resin are
sometimes mixed with copal to cheapen the product or to cause more
rapid drying. Copal is a generic name given originally to all fossil
resins. Copals, as they are called, come from New Zealand, Mozambique,
Zanzibar, West Africa, Brazil, and the Philippines. The best
of the Copals is said to be the Kauri gum, originally exuded from
the Kauri pine tree of New Zealand. The tree is still existent and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[page&nbsp;219]</span>
produces a soft, spongy sap, but the resin used in varnish is dug up
from a few feet under ground in regions where there are now no
trees. A commercially important copal and one noted for its hardness
is the Zanzibar or East African Copal. It is found imbedded
in the earth at a depth not greater than four feet over a wide belt
of the mainland coast of Zanzibar, on tracts where not a single tree
now grows. It occurs in lumps from the size of small pebbles to
pieces weighing four or five pounds. The supply is said to be practically
inexhaustible.</p>

<p>As to the manufacture of the Copal varnishes: first of all, a high
grade oil is boiled at a high temperature, with different materials to
oxidize it; for instance, red lead or oxide of manganese. The heat
throws off the oxygen from the red lead or manganese. The oxygen
is absorbed by the linseed oil, which is then put away to settle and
age. When a batch of varnish is made, the gums are melted in a
large kettle and then the requisite amount of oil is added and these
carefully boiled together. This is removed from the fire and cooled
down to a point, where turpentine can be added without volatilizing.
These are thoroly mixed and then filtered under pressure and tanked
and aged. The different grades of varnish depend upon the treatment
of the oil, the proportion of oil and turpentine, the qualities of the
gums, the aging, etc. Some by rubbing give a very high polish, some
give a dull waxy finish, some are for out-of-door use, as Spar varnish
and carriage varnish, some are for floors, some for furniture, some are
high priced, some are cheap.</p>

<p>Process of Varnishing. The preliminary processes are the same
as those for applying shellac, i.&nbsp;e., the surface of the wood must be
perfectly even and smooth, and the staining, filling, and drying complete.
Quick drying varnishes, like shellac, are applied, with but
little on the brush. The heavy, high lustre varnishes, on the other
hand, are applied with the brush full so that the varnish may even
drip off the work. Then proceed as follows: Wipe off from the
work the extra varnish with the brush and clean the brush on the
edge of the cup. Repeat till the varnish is flowed over the work
evenly. Be particularly careful, in that respect, of edges and corners.
Set to dry in a dustless place. When dry and hard repeat the process
from three to six times. Each coat must dry thoroly before the next
coat is applied.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[page&nbsp;220]</span>

<p>Varnish polishing consists in rubbing off the varnish, not in rubbing
it on, as in French polishing. To polish varnish, rub with a felt
pad, powdered pumice-stone and water. Rub till the surface is smooth,
unpitted and even, being careful not to rub thru the edges. Wipe
clean with a wet sponge and chamois skin. This gives a dull or "egg-shell"
finish. For polishing varnish, a simple method is to rub with
a rotary motion, using a mixture of <span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&frasl;</span><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">2</span> sweet oil or cottonseed oil,
and <span style="font-size: 1.1em;"><sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&frasl;</span><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">2</span> alcohol.</p>

<p>A more laborious process is as follows: After rubbing to a dull
finish, rub ground rotten stone and water with chamois skin in a circular
motion. Let the rotten stone dry on the surface. Then wipe
off with the naked hand, rubbing in a circular direction and wiping
the hand every time after passing over the work. This looks simple,
but is really a fine art. These processes have practically replaced
French polishing in the trade.</p>


<h4>PAINTING</h4>

<p>Paints are used for the same purpose as other finishes, with the
additional one of giving an opaque colored covering. The materials
used are:</p>

<p>1. A body whose function is to give covering power. This is
usually white lead, but it is often adulterated with zinc oxide; 2.
Pigments; 3. Linseed oils, raw and boiled, which are used to give
consistency, adhesiveness and also elasticity to the coat when dry.
For outdoor work boiled oil is used and for indoor work, raw oil;
4. Turpentine, which is used to thin out the paint and to make it
dry more quickly.</p>

<p>The common method of painting is: 1. Set any nails with nailset;
2. Sandpaper; 3. Shellac the knots; 4. Prime with a thin coat
of paint, mostly white lead, (that is, little color,) boiled oil, and
turpentine (the proportion of drying oil is greater than in ordinary
paint); 5. Putty up cracks, nail holes, etc.; 6. Sandpaper if a small
nice job; 7. Then paint two or three coats with paint thick enough
so it will not run, with long, even strokes with the grain. The order
of painting a door is, panels, muntins, rails, and last, stiles.</p>

<p>For inside work use half as much turpentine as oil. This gives a
dull finish. For outside work, where lustre is wanted, little or no
turpentine is used.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[page&nbsp;221]</span>

<p>This is the old way, and is still used for all common work. But
for fine painting, as carriage work, a filler is now used first, because a
priming to be durable should unite with the wood, grasping the
fibers and filling the pores, so that after coats cannot sink in. The
object is to cement the surface. Priming is often called "rough
stuff." The old way did not do this, with the result that the oil separated
from the lead and kept soaking into the wood. The principal
makers of paints now recommend a filler before any white lead is
added.</p>


<h4>TOOLS AND MATERIALS FOR WOOD FINISHING</h4>

<p>Brushes. It is well to have several varieties to help keep them
distinct. For varnish and shellac, the best are those with the bristles
set in hard rubber. For ordinary purposes, brushes one inch wide
are satisfactory. For stains, cheap, tin-bound brushes are good
enough, and are easily replaced.</p>

<p>Cups. Half-pint enameled steel cups are cheap, satisfactory, and
easily kept clean. For the care of cups and brushes, see Chapter VI,
The Equipment and Care of the Shop.</p>

<p>Steel wool. This consists of shavings, turned from thin steel
discs set together in a lathe. It comes in various grades, No. 00 to
No. 3. The finest, No. 00, is coarse enough for ordinary purposes.</p>

<p>Sandpaper. Use No. 00 smeared with boiled oil. Pulverized
pumice stone and pulverized rotten stone, both very fine, are used to
rub down inequalities and to give a dull finish to shellac or varnish.
Use with oil on shellac and with oil or water on copal varnish. Horsehair
and soft wood shavings are often used to rub down varnish.
French felt, medium hard, is used for rubbing down copal varnish
with pumice stone.</p>

<p>Cotton waste is the cheapest available material for wiping.</p>

<p>Cheese cloth is better for some purposes, but more expensive.</p>

<p>Soft cloth without lint is necessary for French polishing. "Berkeley
muslin," "Old Glory," and "Lilly White" are trade names. A
fine quality is necessary. The starch should be washed out and the
cloth dried before using, and then torn into little pieces, say 4" square.</p>

<p>Fillers consist of silex or of ground earths mixed with oil, japan,
and turpentine. Their object is to give a perfectly level and non-absorbent
basis for varnish covering.</p>

<p>Oils. Raw linseed oil is very fat and dries slowly. It is used for
interior work.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[page&nbsp;222]</span>

<p>Boiled oil is linseed oil boiled with litharge (PbO) and white
vitriol, which removes much of the fatty ingredient and gives it drying
quality.</p>

<p>Turpentine is a volatile oil from the sap of long-leaf pine. It is
mixed with oil in painting to give further drying qualities.</p>

<p>Benzine is a cheap substitute for turpentine. It is a highly inflammable
product of coal tar and evaporates quickly.</p>

<p>Drier is an oil in which resin has been dissolved. It is mixed
with varnishes and paint to make them dry quickly. It is also sometimes
used as a varnish itself.</p>

<p>Japan is a varnish-like liquid made of shellac or other resin, linseed
oil, metallic oxides, and turpentine. It is used as a medium in
which to grind colors and as a drier.</p>

	<h4>Transcriber's Note:</h4>
There is no Fig. 19; and Fig. 47 had no caption&mdash;caption added from text.<br /><br />

Some of the illustrations were on numbered pages which contained no text.<br />
Illustrations have been moved to more relevant places, and extraneous page numbers removed.<br />

Page number references from the Index, and from within the text, have been corrected where necessary.<br /><br />

(sundry commas added to Bibliograpy, as needed for consistency.)<br /><br />



<h6>ERRATA, and [sic]</h6>

Page 13: 'thoroly' [sic] period spelling for 'thoroughly'.<br />

Page 16: 'If a horse fall ...' [sic] 'If a horse (should) fall ...'<br />

Page 47: 'eargerly' corrected to 'eagerly'. (They are eagerly sought after...).<br />

Page 47: 'chlorid' corrected to 'chloride'. (zinc chloride).<br />

Page 58: 'splinttering' corrected to 'splintering'.<br />

Page 63: 'especally' corrected to 'especially'.<br />

Page 90: 'varities' corrected to 'varieties'.<br />

Page 160: 'shouders' corrected to 'shoulders'. (Locate accurately with a knife point the shoulders...).<br />

Page 162: Replaced two gaps in text with 'wedges' and 'No. 34'. (<i>No. 35. A wedged</i> ... by driving the wedges into saw kerfs in the tenon instead of along its sides as in No. 34.)<br />

Page 189: 'Fig. 285, E' corrected to 'Fig. 285, C'  (The cover may have cleats on its underside, Fig. 285, C, which fit just inside the box and keep the top in place.)<br />

Page 219: 'funiture' corrected to 'furniture'. (...some are for floors, some for furniture,...)
